0	10000	Hello, everyone.
10000	17960	Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get
17960	19960	started.
19960	25920	Jason, can you please take the minutes today?
25920	29000	Yes, of course, Tony.
29000	32000	No problem.
32000	33000	Thanks.
33000	34000	Okay.
34000	38000	Let's get the ball rolling.
38000	41000	First on the agenda today.
41000	49000	Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy for our new beverage,
49000	51000	Ginger Cola?
51000	53000	Yes, Tony.
53000	62000	Well, we have decided to pitch the new Ginger Cola as a health and energy drink.
62000	65000	Fantastic.
65000	69000	I think this will be our next big hit.
69000	74000	There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.
74000	76000	It tastes great.
76000	79000	It's healthy.
79000	82000	And it has very low calories.
82000	86000	It's perfect for working out.
86000	91000	Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.
91000	97000	Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?
97000	105000	We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter
105000	110000	from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.
110000	117000	We still have to iron out some details, but we think he's a great fit.
117000	120000	Great idea.
120000	130000	Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.
130000	138000	Of course, that's really important, but we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.
138000	141000	Okay, Tony.
141000	145000	I will be ready to present to everyone then.
145000	149000	Let's move on to the next topic.
149000	155000	I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.
155000	166000	It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.
167000	173000	Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.
173000	177000	This is extremely important for us.
177000	181000	We need to give back to the community.
181000	184000	I couldn't agree more.
184000	194000	This has been at the top of all our agendas, and we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.
194000	196000	Let me start things off.
196000	201000	If that's okay with everyone else.
