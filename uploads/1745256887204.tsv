0	10000	Hello everyone!
10000	17900	Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get
17900	19920	started.
19920	25800	Jason, can you please take the minutes today?
25800	28960	Yes, of course, Tony.
28960	31960	No problem.
31960	32960	Thanks.
32960	37960	Okay, let's get the ball rolling.
37960	40960	First on the agenda today.
40960	48960	Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy for our new beverage,
48960	50960	Ginger Cola?
50960	52960	Yes, Tony.
52960	61960	Well, we have decided to pitch the new Ginger Cola as a health and energy drink.
61960	64960	Fantastic.
64960	68960	I think this will be our next big hit.
68960	73960	There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.
73960	76960	It tastes great.
76960	78960	It's healthy.
78960	81960	And it has very low calories.
81960	85960	It's perfect for working out.
85960	90960	Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.
90960	95960	Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?
95960	104960	We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter
104960	109960	from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.
109960	113960	We still have to iron out some details.
113960	117960	But we think he's a great fit.
117960	119960	Great idea.
119960	129960	Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.
129960	133960	Of course, that's really important.
133960	137960	But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.
137960	140960	Okay, Tony.
140960	144960	I will be ready to present to everyone then.
144960	148960	Let's move on to the next topic.
148960	154960	I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.
154960	165960	It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.
166960	172960	Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.
172960	176960	This is extremely important for us.
176960	180960	We need to give back to the community.
180960	183960	I couldn't agree more.
183960	188960	This has been at the top of all our agendas.
188960	193960	And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.
193960	195960	Let me start things off.
195960	200960	If that's okay with everyone else.
