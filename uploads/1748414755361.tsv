0	3280	fancy process and the global transparency reporting.
3280	8320	We do it at entity, at legal entity level.
8320	14320	To why during the project, we wanted to have one combined report
14320	16080	for two legal entities.
16080	18000	What was the rationale behind would you
18000	23800	know that Felix, do you know Rashid?
23800	26200	So for India, we have two company codes.
26200	29400	Ion01 and Ion10.
29400	33320	So now we have been tracking all the payment information,
33320	35640	even when India was an internal market.
35640	38000	We have been using both the company codes
38000	43240	and tracking the details in GTC for both of these company
43240	43960	codes.
43960	49360	We were not sure that these two are two separate legal entities,
49360	50240	so to say.
50240	53920	So this was observed very recently, Matthew,
53920	56560	when we were going to prepare the idea report,
56560	57280	that is very important.
57280	59880	I understand that the details.
59880	61760	So Rashid, if I understand what you're saying
61760	63720	is that there was not a conscious decision
63720	66800	from the global transparency team to merge two legal entities
66800	70600	to one, it's just that we didn't know, right?
70600	72000	OK.
72000	76840	Now, the thing is that then the system has
76840	81160	been set up only for, has been linked to only one legal entity,
81160	84280	not the two of them.
84280	85280	Is that correct, Rashid?
85280	87320	We are uploading data for both.
87320	89960	There is no segregation, but we are uploading data
89960	90800	for both of these.
90800	95680	But for ITR, you would need then two ITR entries
95680	96880	for the two legal entities.
96880	97200	Yes.
97200	99200	Right now, we have a combined report for both
99200	102000	where there is no segregation basis the legal entity.
102000	103600	OK.
103600	107040	And do we know what the local codes say in India?
107040	110200	Do they say one reporting per legal entity?
110200	111920	Is it legal requirements?
111920	114320	I mean, at least a regular requirement.
117320	119320	It is with you.
119320	120520	It needs to.
120520	121840	Yeah, it is.
121840	125680	Because the other entity, which is the Novartis India
125680	129040	Limited, is the listed entity.
129040	131680	It's listed on the stock exchange.
131680	135840	And that needs to be disclosed separately.
135840	138240	OK.
138240	141480	And I think then the answer is pretty simple, right?
141480	145120	So what is the deadline for the reporting?
145120	147480	I understand it's in a week time.
147480	149360	It's end of May.
149360	151920	This weekend, I would say, target.
151920	152720	OK.
152720	158800	So there is no chance that with IQVA, we can set up the ITR
158800	160240	for the missing legal entities.
160240	163240	Is it a statistic?
163240	164240	I don't think so, Matthew.
164240	167520	But what we can do is one option is we can generate
167520	171320	at least one report with the maximum major values
171320	176440	and invalidate some of the spends for other legal entities.
176440	177360	OK.
177360	179040	Yes, definitely.
179040	185920	It's one possibility that we do Novartis LSCAR LTT
185920	187680	with ITR.
187680	191240	The only risk that we have is the duplicating,
191240	194200	the duplicate reporting, because there might be
194200	199240	how will you split the TEOVs per legal entity?
199240	200880	You see what I mean?
200880	204440	Satish is that there is a risk that we report some of the TEOVs
204440	207640	that are linked to Novartis India LTT,
207640	211120	meaning that when they will do the manual reporting
211120	215760	in Excel or whatever, there might be some duplicating TEOVs there.
215760	218400	No, we have that segregation at SAP level,
218400	219960	because we are using that data.
219960	222400	We have that segregation at the end.
222440	225360	So this is my understanding, Matthew.
225360	227200	We can generate one report.
227200	231520	So we can look at the maximum line items and maximum volume.
231520	236440	And if the volume with Novartis India limited is less,
236440	240760	then we can invalidate them and still generate a ITR report.
240760	242760	OK, so we can manually do that.
242760	245280	So for that expense, it's just one less question
245280	246200	before we take a decision.
246200	248560	So for that expense is clear, and I understand
248560	252360	there is no risk of duplication for indirect spend colleagues.
252800	254720	How do we make the split between the TEOVs?
254720	257960	For us, the source of data is only SAP Matthew.
257960	259840	There is no other indirect also.
259840	262680	We are taking it from SAP only.
262680	263520	Then we are good.
266000	270760	So I need this.
270760	274640	I would effectively be in favor to use the global transparency
274640	277640	solution for the reporting of one of the TEOVs,
277640	281840	but I really want the local compliance team
281840	285160	to be comfortable with that.
285160	285920	Perfect.
285920	289480	So Matthew, really the challenge is here on the second point.
289480	290760	Product is pretty quickly.
290760	293640	We already discussed earlier with Rashi.
293640	296080	And there was a work around that they proposed right now,
296080	298080	which we could have worked.
298080	300240	But challenge really is the second point
300240	304040	where we would have to capture the posting data as well,
304040	306640	which is not there currently in the SAP I bear report.
306640	310800	So that means we will have a missing data coming in the ITR report.
310800	311600	OK.
312440	315280	Just on this front, I don't.
315280	318720	So this is very different.
318720	321320	Usually transparency reporting is based on payment.
321320	326360	So we are disclosing what Novartis effectively
326360	330960	give to HTTP's, HEO's, and patient organizations.
330960	333200	What I'm trying to understand is, is it
333200	337160	are we sure that this is the regulatory requirement
337160	342240	to disclose at an event level and not at payment level,
342240	343680	because this is very new to me.
343680	346720	We don't have such situation in any of the 50
346720	349160	pressed countries that we are managing.
349160	351400	So Matthew, you're absolutely correct.
351400	354200	So Novartis, so not Novartis, India
354200	357280	has got a pretty unique regulatory requirement,
357280	361680	which requires the pharmaceutical organizations
361680	364600	to report at the event level, which
364600	370200	means once an event happens and the provisions are made,
370200	376760	so the postings that happens through the financial reporting
376760	379440	needs to be captured.
379440	381800	And this clarification has been
381800	385960	grow, has been received through the industry association,
385960	390800	and also through the Department of Pharmaceuticals
390800	392920	for India.
392960	395480	So this is a directive that we've,
395480	400480	so what happens is for March 31st is the annual year end.
400480	404520	So events that happen the last week or in the month,
404520	408040	depending on the contact of the vendors,
408040	411640	the payment will not get processed in time,
411640	413520	but it will get provisioned.
413520	418040	And if it gets provisioned, it can still be posted.
418040	418880	Yeah.
418880	421080	Payment can happen at a later stage.
421080	423880	So that needs to be, and because the event
423880	427240	has happened within the fiscal year,
427240	430160	it needs to be captured in the report.
430160	431720	Nice images.
431720	432960	OK.
432960	439200	But so, and we have a clear view on what
439200	445680	has been accrued as of March 31st, that the net needs,
445680	448600	sorry, that they need to be reported.
448600	450920	Do we have a clear visibility on the accords?
450920	451760	Absolutely.
451760	454560	There was absolutely, yes.
454560	456960	So Matthew, we know that there are payments that are posted,
456960	461000	which have to be considered for the purpose of reporting.
461000	463080	But if you are asking clear visibility,
463080	467200	I think we don't have that split between what is the exact payment
467200	471400	that needs to be, that is in the posting case state,
471400	474000	because that keeps on changing a week after week.
477120	478840	Can you repeat this last sentence?
478840	481600	I'll teach you the issue of the issue of the issue of the accords.
481600	485680	So let's assume you have an event of 100.
485680	489440	60 has been already invoiced as of March 1st,
489440	492680	so it's in an L has been paid, sorry, as in paid.
492680	494480	So it's already in ACP.
494480	496400	You have 40.
496400	498760	You know that the service has been executed,
498760	501600	so you have 40 that has been accrued.
501600	505560	But by March 31st, this has not been paid.
505560	509240	But those 40, if I understand well the whole that we have in India,
509240	511880	those 40 needs to be reflected.
511880	514640	But with the accords that have been done,
514640	518520	we should be able to link the accrued amount with the event.
518520	521200	No?
521200	525320	So Matthew, we don't have this event while identification.
525320	527200	There is a payment that does not happen yet.
530440	532680	So we don't have even spy event,
532680	537560	the split between paid and accrued.
537560	542880	But then colleagues, I mean, please don't get us wrong.
542880	544840	We will never force you to use a system
544840	546360	that you are not comfortable to use.
546360	548480	Honestly, considering the situation
548480	551320	and considering that we need to report by the end of the week,
551320	555240	this is really, we need to go with what we use,
555240	558000	what we feel is the best solution.
558000	561360	The thing is, if you don't have it for the global transparency solution,
561360	564280	you will not have it neither for in Excel, right?
564280	569920	So how do you plan to solve this?
569920	571280	You see what I mean?
571280	572160	You see what I mean?
572160	577200	If you don't have an ACP and you don't have the accrual pair events,
577200	579440	even if you are not using the global transparency solution
579440	584240	and you do the reporting manually, how will you do that?
584240	588720	OK, so the payment which has been happened in SAP
588720	591640	that we can find out from SAP IBI.
591640	594120	Now, the issue right now, what we are having
594120	598480	that those events which happened in February, March,
598480	602840	their invoice have been posted in SAP,
602840	605600	but that does not been paid because payment
605600	610920	would happen basis the credit arms of the vendors.
610920	613760	So it received not invoiced?
613760	614640	Yes.
614640	619640	So if we can see, we may see our status in SAP
619640	624520	as a post date or created or index, but not the paid.
624520	628120	And that paid goes to SAP IBI.
628120	632840	So those payments basis the SAP individual data.
632840	636840	We have taken an account and factored for reporting,
636840	641840	but those data is completely missed in this SAP IBI, IBI report.
641840	646120	Probably in future, one, two months, probably two months
646120	648960	down the line, we may get the data.
648960	654040	So that is the reason, the manual data captured,
654040	662880	all which are paid plus provision plus a post date.
662880	664960	I'm happy just to simplify.
664960	667480	In Be sure, we always capture the quotation
667480	669120	as well as invoices.
669120	671640	The basis there, the tracking was already prepared
671640	674680	by the third party, which captures against which event,
674680	677120	which are the payments pending to be posted
677120	680520	and which are already in the SAP.
680520	682760	So we have that available, but it is just
682760	685000	that we don't have a report which clearly
685000	688480	by for case, what is paid and posted in SAP right now.
688480	693720	So it was a manual of what that has enabled us to reconcile
693720	694640	all of this.
694640	695240	Mathya.
695240	696000	Yeah.
696000	697560	Yeah, Mathya.
697560	698600	Yeah.
698880	701000	And there were two other three, I mean,
701000	703120	incidentals, but important.
703120	705160	One, this is the first time, of course, India
705160	708560	is coming under the Transparency Reporting Act,
708560	712840	and which means, and also given whatever indications
712840	715640	that we have, the multinational organizations
715640	717840	are going to be under a lot more scrutiny
717840	720880	than the local organizations are.
720880	723280	They've already made an example of one
723280	727040	of the multinational organizations a few months back
727040	729280	on one of the breaches.
729280	733280	And all indications are that all multinational organizations
733280	736200	are going to be under heavy scrutiny
736200	738640	for at least the cycle, right?
738640	742040	So hence, there has been a lot of reliance on what
742040	746160	is going to be a uniform standard approach to reporting
746160	750120	across the members, the member organizations
750120	752280	of the association.
752280	755840	And we are having a uniform approach
755840	760240	towards reporting some of these, right?
760240	764800	So we are being a lot more conservative and not aggressive.
764800	768440	And we are ensuring that even the ones
768440	773200	which have been accrued, and one spare services have been
773200	776200	taken, but payments will be made at a later stage.
776200	778720	They'll still be reported.
778720	782520	There is a provision where we have,
783240	785840	used disclaimers.
785840	788280	And we have also put in those comments,
788280	790800	but not exhaustive, limited comments,
790800	794080	just to ensure that some of the clarity could be
794080	796080	provided towards some of these items.
796080	800680	So hence, the concern on how we really show up
800680	803040	in the first year of reporting.
803040	804680	But Adi Nash, then, are you telling me
804680	809880	that you already have done the data collection, right?
809880	812200	For what you believe should be disclosed
812200	814920	by the end of this week.
814920	818280	You have for the truly guaranteed days.
818280	819120	Yeah.
822120	826280	I mean, what is the question today?
826280	828720	Is it the, are you asking for an exemption
828720	830880	to use the global solution and the global end
830880	832320	to follow the global process?
834520	836000	Now, that's the intent, Matthew.
836000	838760	Just to bring you wherever.
838760	839280	Thank you.
839280	841520	Where that goes from the country
841520	843360	is to go with the manual disclosure,
843360	847880	but for now, standard global transparency solution
847880	849720	because we recently implemented.
849720	852800	I'm absolutely, but for me, it's fine.
852800	853640	Absolutely.
853640	855240	I mean, I will never prevent you
855240	857120	to do what you feel it's best for you.
857120	859280	We are no one to say that.
859280	860880	I mean, I feel it's a little bit ashamed
860880	863360	that the teams and so much effort to implement.
863360	865520	I don't know exactly if we missed something
865520	868960	in the business requirements,
868960	871800	or if we did not enough listen to you.
871800	875000	But obviously, if you have the report really
875000	877960	in with the manual data collection
877960	879960	and you feel comfortable with the figures,
879960	882480	you should report that you have definitely.
882480	884040	I mean, I don't know.
884040	886720	I mean, Ashley, is it what you were asking for more?
886720	888440	That was the, that was the ask,
888440	893960	but you will also develop a couple of other evolving
893960	894800	situations.
894800	896720	The other evolving situation was one
896720	901520	of the key signatories to the transparency report
901520	903520	was the country precedent.
903520	906160	And the country precedent would have
906160	908920	to record a signature on the report
908920	911280	before the report is presented.
911280	913360	And he was also traveling.
913360	916440	So he's currently out of the country.
916440	919600	So before he moved out of the country
919600	922840	or official purpose, we had to kind of see the report.
924440	929080	And be comfortable with what was captured in the report.
929080	931760	So if, and those were the pieces.
931760	934160	And of course, all of this was in accordance
934160	940360	and in line with how the association guided us.
940360	944120	And what was the directive in terms
944120	946200	of how it had to be presented.
946200	952040	So those were, of course, weighed in also very heavily.
952040	956840	And hence the ask and the request from Ashley.
956840	959880	I mean, Ashley, no, no, so let's go apparently,
959880	963160	you're already, you know, you're done with the reporting.
963160	965240	So let's continue what you've initiated.
965240	970040	Just first of all, and I hope, let's be,
970040	971840	let's speak honestly and transparently,
971840	973480	even if the team is on the phone today.
973480	977040	But do you feel that we, we as a global transparency team,
977040	979040	we miss something about your requirements.
979040	982280	And using that, that there was a misduring the project
982280	986160	that we, explaining why we are facing this situation today.
987320	988520	Matthew, I'm really sorry.
988520	990560	I don't have the historical reference
990560	993040	because I got into the role six months back.
993040	994040	Okay.
994040	999040	And, and I'm, I'm just carrying the work
999960	1002320	that was already underway.
1003640	1006760	So I, I'm not really, okay.
1006760	1010440	I'm sure of what conversations have happened before.
1010440	1011440	I'm really sorry.
1011440	1014480	I'm not able to throw much light on that.
1014480	1016440	Okay, maybe satish one last question
1016440	1017640	and then I ended up to you.
1017640	1022240	So, at the nation and, and how much are they on?
1022240	1024520	Are you comfortable also?
1024520	1028000	And can we say that, even if this one is done manually?
1028000	1030320	First, we would need to, if this is okay with you,
1030320	1032800	we would need to load the data into the global transparency
1032800	1036480	solution because for internal analytics purpose,
1036480	1039360	we need to have a full view of the total transfer of values
1039360	1042600	for the company because we are presenting, for example,
1042600	1044400	to Patrick Harper on Monday.
1044400	1048640	And he wants to see the entire, the, the entire tier of his,
1048640	1053120	but this one and they're also more importantly,
1053120	1055440	because this one is just for internal analytics,
1055440	1057880	but more importantly, are you comfortable that,
1057880	1059800	for the, I mean, are you okay?
1059800	1062960	Sorry, that for the future, we will really understand
1063760	1068760	how we should address the issues and moving for one final solution
1071080	1073920	for you to get the data directly from the global solution
1073920	1077200	because colleagues, these should save significant time
1077200	1078160	on you, right?
1078160	1080480	And so sorry that you spent so much time
1080480	1082840	on transparency, but in the future,
1082840	1084520	we should be able to provide you something
1084520	1087840	that you are mostly comfortable with and you just review
1087840	1091200	and sign off if you agree with you.
1091200	1093880	Okay, absolutely, absolutely Matthew,
1093880	1096000	and I think that's the whole idea.
1096000	1100040	And we would definitely going forward
1100040	1103800	like to rely on the global transparency tool.
1103800	1107440	And we need to find some solutions to some of these challenges
1107440	1111880	that we have enough in our, in our systems today
1111880	1115920	and how do we really overcome that,
1115920	1118520	but we're really looking up to you
1118520	1121080	to help us find solutions.
1121080	1124320	But that's clearly the intent.
1124320	1126000	I would really want to ask you,
1126000	1128120	what do we also want to kind of share?
1128120	1130760	What's our finding of the reporting
1130760	1132400	and how our format looks like
1132400	1134520	and what is it that you want to share with them?
1136040	1138440	In the current UCP, report, how is it?
1138440	1141160	Do you want to share that data also with them?
1141160	1145800	Yes, so we have actually have that format ready
1145800	1147800	with us, the way UCP and P,
1147800	1153040	asked us to report it with the total amount
1153040	1155760	and total aggregate level.
1155760	1160440	So, and we got this data from the backup data
1160440	1165440	where we have the spent, under different spend here.
1167400	1171760	So we are having a specific data set
1171760	1175200	for speaker fees, render fees and also it gives
1175200	1180200	a complete visibility how that total data is coming for.
1181560	1184040	So we have the backup data and from there,
1184040	1188200	we have generated the report.
1188200	1190640	Okay, so we will load your report
1190640	1193200	into the global transparency solution, right?
1194200	1196240	Afterwards, once you've published,
1196240	1197760	we will take your data excel
1197760	1201360	and we will load that into the global transparency solution.
1202360	1204400	So Matthew, do you mean to say
1204400	1208640	that once this posted entries or posted SAP line items
1208640	1211680	are reaching in the SAP IBI?
1211680	1212680	That's when we do it?
1216840	1218000	I need to discuss with the team
1218000	1219760	because you're absolutely right, sorry.
1219760	1222120	We already have access to the data, right?
1222120	1224000	Because we already have the interface with ACP,
1224000	1226400	so we don't need to reload your Excel file,
1226400	1228080	we have the data, okay?
1228080	1230920	Now forget about what I said and forget about what I said.
1231880	1235320	No, the only question mark would be on the RCF control
1235320	1239120	colleagues, so there are like six, so now it's nine,
1239120	1240400	we increase to nine.
1240400	1245400	We have nine RCF controls that we need to execute
1246440	1250640	on the countries in scope of transparency reporting.
1250640	1254280	And so we need to see how we do that without you
1254280	1256200	following the global process.
1256200	1257960	But it's manageable, we do it with the US
1257960	1260240	and they are not following the global process.
1260760	1263640	So just that please keep in mind that we need to work together
1263640	1265000	on the RCF controls.
1267000	1268360	And it's all about colleagues,
1268360	1272040	it's all about reconciliation between SAP
1272040	1277040	and what has been reported, so it's as your face,
1277560	1282360	I think it's a URR, RCF, are you familiar with RCF?
1282360	1284920	Yeah, so that's what I'm talking about.
1284920	1286800	Self-assessment, right?
1286800	1288320	Sorry, yeah, self-assessment,
1288320	1290600	I'm key control testing.
1290600	1294440	Yeah, one that is supposed to be done in July.
1295640	1297240	Yeah, you're correct.
1298560	1300200	You're already very familiar with the process.
1300200	1302560	Yes, correct.
1302560	1304680	So reset issue, you are waiting for some time.
1304680	1307160	Sorry, no worries Matthew.
1307160	1310040	Just to commend on the question that you asked,
1310040	1313280	did we miss during the initial project scooping?
1313280	1316480	I have double verified all the URR's documentation
1316480	1320680	plus the confirmation that we got during the input collection
1320680	1323280	when we have set in the ITR also.
1323280	1325320	So this is not a miss,
1325320	1328680	the information came out to light very recently.
1328680	1332320	So I can share the information of course.
1332320	1334880	I definitely did, but I can tell from Matthew.
1334880	1336280	But Matthew, I think you know,
1336280	1339160	I don't think we should look at this as a miss
1339160	1342080	or a lack of support,
1342080	1344920	but I think being the first year of transparency,
1344920	1347880	supporting a lot of these aspects
1347880	1351840	are also learning for us as well, right?
1351840	1356640	So I think we are also learning as we're going along
1356640	1359800	and some of these pieces which were never,
1359800	1362200	I mean, which used to happen the way it is happening,
1362200	1364640	but we never really saw that.
1364640	1368360	For example, the posting bit,
1368360	1371080	it never really probably occurred to us
1371080	1373320	that this is the way it would be.
1373320	1378320	So I think it's more of a discovery phase.
1378800	1381000	Today as we've completed the year,
1381000	1385280	I think we are a lot more informed of how things have,
1385280	1387600	what things happen and how they get reported
1387600	1389720	and what we need to keep in mind.
1389720	1393360	And I think we just need to kind of really integrate
1393360	1394920	that into our tool,
1394920	1397920	but I don't need that as a miss or a lack of support.
1397920	1399760	I don't see it that way.
1399800	1403800	I just see that as a first-time unique experience
1403800	1404640	that we've had.
1404640	1408160	And so we might not have been able to articulate everything
1408160	1409600	and we might not have been visible
1409600	1412680	of every possible thing that there is.
1413680	1414720	And to that extent,
1414720	1417160	there could also be a miss from our end,
1417160	1420280	but I don't see that as a lack of support from any team.
1420280	1421440	Definitely not.
1421440	1422680	No, no, no, I'm glad you said,
1422680	1423480	you're not doing this,
1423480	1425280	I think we're pointing to us now.
1425280	1426240	So I'd now appreciate that.
1426240	1428880	I'm not really good.
1428880	1433320	And this is true that with the complex regulatory requirements,
1433320	1436120	this is true that sometimes it takes a bit,
1436120	1439320	it's not as straightforward as a normal FIA country.
1440520	1443080	So, yeah, I mean, it is what it is.
1443080	1444080	But thanks a lot.
1444080	1446160	So just to kind of share that's okay, Matthew.
1446160	1448640	So there were some member organizations
1448640	1451520	which were using GKC tools in their own,
1451520	1455240	it could be astral or it could be BMS, I don't remember.
1455240	1458360	And when they came and there were many workshops
1458360	1462400	that were conducted by the local association,
1462400	1465120	industry association on this topic, right?
1465120	1470120	And one that we recently participated in,
1471560	1473720	I think they were talking about the challenges
1473720	1477520	of their global GTC tool exactly on these fronts.
1477520	1478360	Yeah.
1478360	1481800	Because even their tool was unable to capture
1481800	1485560	the post-aid or the accrued ADA,
1485560	1488720	and it's just giving them an aggregated ones.
1489680	1491520	Because that's the requirement
1491520	1494960	across the other affiliate countries worldwide.
1494960	1497800	India is a very different, unique local, global,
1497800	1500920	global, the requirement of the government
1500920	1502560	is very, very different.
1502560	1506720	So then they have resorted also to manual pieces
1506720	1509000	and to ensure that all the member organization
1509000	1510720	have a standard approach.
1510720	1512240	So there was a directive saying
1512240	1513720	that let's approach it this way.
1513720	1516040	So it's evolving one method.
1516040	1518960	So honestly, time may be venting,
1518960	1521760	looked at the data, we really were trying to rack up brains
1521760	1524160	and say that, how do we do this?
1524160	1526920	Can you just, yeah, please.
1526920	1529280	You here to understand this,
1529280	1532920	is there any opportunity for India to do a republication
1534000	1538520	or do we really strict about any republication?
1538520	1540520	Why would you do a question?
1540520	1541880	What would a question is a case?
1541880	1545000	I think even this was the question that some of us asked.
1545000	1548840	Because the fear of misreporting was so high,
1548840	1552560	we checked with the DOP if there was a case of,
1552560	1557560	or if there's a possibility of re-submitting this,
1558840	1561840	just like your income tax, advance tax, et cetera.
1561840	1565160	And it's still the question up in the air.
1565160	1566400	We don't know.
1566400	1567560	We don't know what DOP,
1567560	1571920	because DOP is keeping all the cards pretty close to the chest.
1573200	1576480	And we really don't know what would the directives be
1576480	1580320	and how, and if they would allow us a review,
1580320	1582840	because a lot of companies came up with the proposal
1582840	1584200	that things would be a lot more clear
1584200	1586440	or post 31st of March.
1586440	1588080	And after we have submitted,
1588080	1590080	there could be a lot more clarity that would come in.
1590080	1593000	So do we have an opportunity to re-submitted?
1593000	1595560	We have had no response to this.
1595560	1600560	We'll have to wait and watch and see how things evolve from here.
1601520	1606120	The reason I wish, the way that we approach the GT solution,
1606120	1608680	it is same for all the markets, right?
1608680	1611560	But the only difference that I see between other markets
1611560	1614600	and India is, the window is only two months.
1614600	1617760	So for other countries, it is around six months.
1617760	1622000	So by the time when we do a disclosure for other markets,
1622000	1625800	all the actuals are already paid.
1625800	1629400	That means the clear dates already come with us, right?
1629400	1631640	So that we were able to disclose all the data.
1633480	1636560	So that's the reason I'm just looking at
1636560	1638960	if there is any opportunity for re-submitting the report
1638960	1642600	after a quarter or so, then it would solve by itself.
1642600	1644800	You know, the two that we have.
1645680	1649240	I think we have requested as an organization,
1649240	1654080	as an association for a window again, Sathish,
1654080	1656360	but there has been no response from the DOP.
1657320	1661160	But if that happens and if there is a second window available,
1661160	1665640	going forward, then GTC tool becomes the best option, right?
1665640	1670640	So, but without any modifications in the current way, right?
1671240	1673960	Because then everything gets easily visible
1673960	1676240	and you can just report whatever really comes out of it.
1676240	1678680	But if it is not, if it is not,
1678680	1681480	then we might have to really rethink on the design
1681480	1685800	and see what can be changed
1685800	1690120	and how can we really capture the posted data.
1692160	1695080	But that's for a later date, but let's just go ahead.
1695080	1697120	But this is a window question.
1697120	1698080	It's still up in the air.
1698080	1699760	We don't know how it's going to manifest,
1699760	1701640	but just give us some time.
1701640	1704000	We will definitely keep you informed
1704000	1706880	of what and how this is evolving.
1706880	1710320	But at the stage, I'm as clueless as you are.
1710320	1712120	Honestly, I don't have any answer.
1712120	1713120	Thank you.
1713120	1715360	And Chris, we'll need to do a make a reconciliation
1715360	1719880	between SAP and Bishur, with definitively.
1719880	1723680	And once there will be this reconciliation option
1723680	1725960	in Bishur, maybe, I mean, we have already
1725960	1728520	the reconciliation option in Bishur with SAP to be.
1730520	1732520	We have two media.
1732520	1734640	These terms are not actually linked, Matthew.
1734640	1737760	Be sure this app, they don't speak to each other.
1737760	1739960	But it's my understanding is that it's
1739960	1743000	planned for various in the next three days or two, right?
1743000	1746600	It should be available very soon.
1746600	1749120	Probably as a country, we don't have that information, Matthew.
1749120	1751320	OK, the second I will check with the person
1751320	1753240	with the system owner in the browser.
1753240	1754200	I will check that too.
1754200	1755200	I will let you know.
1755200	1757680	Because then, then, also, soft truths
1757680	1761480	will be more be sure than SAP then.
1761480	1762000	For you.
1762000	1764160	Call the particulates.
1764160	1766520	So Matthew, we also have another third system, which
1766520	1768960	is conquer, because there are times
1768960	1774000	when we also book the flights, et cetera,
1774000	1776800	accommodation through conquer.
1776800	1777800	Yeah.
1777800	1778800	OK.
1778800	1779800	Easy.
1779800	1780800	Easy.
1780800	1781800	PCD.
1781800	1784760	It is not integrated.
1784760	1789200	The PCD is integrated with GTC.
1789200	1791000	It's a global transparency solution.
1791800	1793800	Yeah.
1793800	1794560	OK.
1794560	1796800	I mean, look, this is a discussion we
1796800	1797680	can continue.
1797680	1799080	We are already over time.
1799080	1801720	But definitely, let's conclude.
1801720	1803840	Please, thanks, colleagues, so much for your manual,
1803840	1807920	for having prepared the disclosure manually.
1807920	1810080	Big, big, big thank you for that.
1810080	1812680	Effectively, it's a distance for us as well.
1812680	1814960	And let's meet after your disclosure in order
1814960	1817720	to make sure that we adjust our process
1817720	1819800	in order to make your requirements.
1819800	1824640	But, colleagues, we are covering 50 plus countries.
1824640	1828200	So I'm very sure that even if you have specific requirements,
1828200	1829080	we will manage.
1829080	1830440	We should manage.
1830440	1832280	We will be able to achieve that.
1832280	1833120	No, thank you, Matthew.
1833120	1837520	In fact, we definitely want to rely on GTC
1837520	1841240	for the upcoming reporting the next year.
1841240	1843880	And we will come back to you with what
1843880	1847200	is the status with the DOP this year.
1847200	1849680	We'll share with you everything that we have.
1849680	1852200	And we'll walk together and see what we can do.
1852200	1853040	Fantastic.
1853040	1853800	Fantastic.
1853800	1854480	Hey, Avina, sure.
1854480	1856680	So I know the expectations are there
1856680	1859760	from the local association, just to be realistic also
1859760	1862160	from what we observed from the other countries
1862160	1864640	with the first year of disclosure.
1864640	1867800	Honestly, you need exactly, as you say before,
1867800	1870000	the companies then in a few years
1870000	1873240	to be at the level that is expected from the association.
1873240	1875880	So I wouldn't worry too much to be honest with you.
1875880	1877280	Absolutely.
1877280	1879840	It's just that there have been a few instances
1879840	1884600	where the government is being a little hard
1884600	1886880	on a couple of organizations.
1886880	1890000	So we just don't want to be on the wrong side.
1890000	1893680	And it's just that all the presidents
1893680	1898480	are just being doubly careful, more cautious than brave.
1898480	1900600	So I think we'll get there.
1900600	1903680	So hopefully the ticket can lead to fines.
1903680	1905360	It's more than fines.
1905360	1908280	They won't be prosecuted.
1908280	1910440	Is it a loo or is it a good?
1910440	1910960	It's a loo.
1910960	1911800	So what?
1911800	1915640	So I think in the first year, given one
1915640	1919400	of the member organizations, the government
1919400	1924080	has come so hard that it's not just so a lot of agencies
1924080	1927640	can really come after you, the income tax.
1927640	1931440	And all of the investigative agencies
1931440	1934040	can really open, can come knocking on the doors.
1934040	1935400	This is this.
1935400	1936840	And that's the worry.
1936840	1940520	And all your books of account are going to be opened up.
1940520	1943560	So I don't know how this will mature.
1943560	1946240	And given the first year, at this point of time,
1946240	1947800	it's only conjecture.
1947800	1950800	But I think if we will have to just wait and watch
1950800	1952880	what's the maturity with which government really
1952880	1955920	looks at this and how it handles this.
1955920	1957160	But at this point of time, it really
1957160	1958560	looks very draconian.
1958560	1961320	And it's more fear.
1961320	1965760	And hence, people are a little cautious
1965760	1968640	and don't want to be on the wrong side.
1968640	1970920	So that's the whole idea, Matthew.
1970920	1972920	OK.
1972920	1975440	Look, we are here.
1975440	1978720	So it's not because you agree that you will do it manually.
1978720	1981640	If you need any help, we are a big team.
1981640	1983000	40 plus people.
1983000	1984160	We are here to support you.
1984160	1988080	So should you need our help to reduce something,
1988080	1990160	to load data for you or whatever it is,
1990160	1992720	just let us know.
1992720	1994440	Really big help, Matthew.
1994440	1997680	Thanks a ton to you and your team for the help and support.
1997680	1999720	And Rashi has been of great help.
1999720	2000880	And I don't see it again.
2000880	2001720	I want to re-emphasize.
2001720	2003240	I don't think it's a lack of support.
2003240	2005720	In fact, we've had a lot of support.
2005720	2007800	And I can go and record to say this.
2007800	2010240	And at least the last six months, I've
2010240	2012040	missed a lot of support.
2012040	2015320	And I think it's because it's an evolving and a dynamic one,
2015320	2019320	it's possible that we've also missed a couple of things.
2019320	2021960	But just give us this one cycle.
2021960	2024000	And we'll see how it goes from year on.
2024000	2024800	Sounds big.
2024800	2025480	Sounds big.
2025480	2027320	And thanks for saying that about the team.
2027320	2028880	I had not done that up to 30.
2028880	2030400	But thanks for saying.
2030400	2031920	Thank you so much.
2031920	2032680	Take care.
2032680	2033200	We stay here.
2033200	2034200	Thanks a lot.
2034200	2034720	Thank you.
2034720	2035720	Thank you.
2035720	2036560	Thank you.
2036560	2038200	Take care, everyone.
2038200	2038960	Hey, thanks.
