00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
Tim and Melinda are running late.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,040
But we have a lot to get through.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,960
So we should get started.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,480
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, of course, Tony.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,760
No problem.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,640
Thanks.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,840
OK, let's get the ball rolling.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
First on the agenda today.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,720
Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,080
for our new beverage, ginger cola?

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,320
Yes, Tony.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,040
Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,600
as a health and energy drink.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,960
Fantastic.

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,240
I think this will be our next big hit.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,040
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,680
It tastes great.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,040
It's healthy.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
And it has very low calories.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,280
It's perfect for working out.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,240
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,960
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,280
We still have a few things to work out.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
But we are planning to have a power hitter

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,160
from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,120
We still have to iron out some details.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,880
But we think he's a great fit.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,400
Great idea.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,480
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,360
for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,040
Of course, that's really important.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,760
But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,560
OK, Tony, I will be ready to present to everyone then.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,280
Let's move on to the next topic.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
I have sent around an action list for each of you

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,240
to take a look at.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,080
It includes a look at the following calls to action

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,360
that we need to address for the upcoming charity

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,880
Walkathon.

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,240
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,080
This is extremely important for us.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,040
We need to give back to the community.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,360
I couldn't agree more.

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,920
This has been at the top of all our agendas.

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,960
And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Let me start things off.

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,680
If that's OK with everyone else.
