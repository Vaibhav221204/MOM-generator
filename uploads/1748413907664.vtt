WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
So we are taking it from SAP only.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.320
Then we are good.

00:07.840 --> 00:13.480
So I need the, I mean, this I would effectively

00:13.480 --> 00:17.080
be in favor to use the global transparency solution

00:17.080 --> 00:19.480
for the reporting of one of the legal entities,

00:19.480 --> 00:23.680
but I really want the local compliance team

00:23.680 --> 00:27.000
to be comfortable with that.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.320
So Matthew, really, the challenge is here on the second point.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.480
The legal entity we already discussed earlier with Rashi.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.920
And there was a work around that they proposed right now,

00:37.920 --> 00:39.920
which we could have worked.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.080
But challenge really is the second point

00:42.080 --> 00:45.880
where we would have to capture the posting data as well,

00:45.880 --> 00:48.480
which is not there currently in the SAP IPA report.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.960
So that means we will have a missing data coming

00:50.960 --> 00:52.680
in the IPA report.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.280
OK.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.120
Just on this front, I don't.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.560
So this is very different.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.160
Usually transparency reporting is based on payment.

01:03.160 --> 01:08.200
So we are disclosing what Novartis effectively

01:08.200 --> 01:12.840
give to HCPs, HCOs, and patient organizations.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.640
What I'm trying to understand is, are we sure

01:15.640 --> 01:19.000
that this is the regulatory requirement

01:19.000 --> 01:24.040
to disclose at an event level and not at payment level?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.520
Because this is very new to me.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.600
We don't have such situation in any of the 50

01:28.600 --> 01:31.000
plus countries that we are managing.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.240
So Matthew, you're absolutely correct.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.040
So Novartis, not Novartis, India

01:36.040 --> 01:39.120
has got a pre-unique regulatory requirement

01:39.120 --> 01:43.520
which requires the pharmaceutical organizations

01:43.520 --> 01:46.440
to report at the event level, which

01:46.440 --> 01:52.040
means once an event happens and the provisions are made.

01:52.040 --> 01:58.600
So the postings that happens through the financial reporting

01:58.600 --> 02:01.520
needs to be captured.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.600
And this clarification has been

02:03.600 --> 02:07.800
grow, has been received through the industry association

02:07.800 --> 02:12.640
and also through the Department of Pharmaceuticals

02:12.640 --> 02:14.720
for India.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.280
So this is a directive that we've...

02:17.280 --> 02:21.400
So what happens is, March 31st is the annual year

02:22.240 --> 02:26.280
so events that happen the last week or in the month,

02:26.280 --> 02:29.840
depending on the contract of the vendors,

02:29.840 --> 02:33.440
the payment will not get processed in time,

02:33.440 --> 02:35.280
but it will get provisioned.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.680
And if it gets provisioned, it can still be posted.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
Yeah.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.840
The payment can happen at a later stage.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.600
So that needs to be...

02:44.600 --> 02:49.000
And because the event has happened within the fiscal year,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.920
it needs to be captured in the report.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.480
Nice images.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.720
OK.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.440
But so...

02:58.440 --> 03:02.920
And we have a clear view on what has been accrued

03:02.920 --> 03:10.320
as of March 31st that needs to be reported

03:10.320 --> 03:12.680
to we have a clear visibility on the accords.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.480
Really?

03:13.480 --> 03:14.280
Absolutely.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.080
Absolutely, yes.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.080
Yeah.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.640
I know that there are payment that are posted,

03:19.640 --> 03:22.960
which have to be considered for the purpose of reporting.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.160
But if you are asking clear visibility,

03:25.160 --> 03:29.120
as in we don't have that split between what is the exact payment

03:29.120 --> 03:31.160
that needs to be...

03:31.160 --> 03:33.320
That is in the posting case state.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.000
Because that keeps on changing a week after week.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.720
Can you repeat this last sentence?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.520
I'll teach you the issue of the...

03:42.520 --> 03:43.560
So if you have the accords...

03:43.560 --> 03:47.440
Let's assume you have an event of 100.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.200
60 has been already invoiced as of March 1st,

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
so it's in...

03:52.200 --> 03:54.480
And it has been paid, sorry, as in paid.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.280
So it's already in ACP.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.200
You have 40.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.560
You know that the service has been executed,

04:00.560 --> 04:03.400
so you have 40 that has been accrued.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.360
But by March 31st, this has not been paid.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.720
But those 40, if I understand well the rule

04:09.720 --> 04:13.480
that we have in India, those 40 needs to be reflected.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.480
But with the accords that have been done,

04:16.480 --> 04:19.240
we should be able to link the accrued amount

04:19.240 --> 04:20.840
with the event, no?

04:23.160 --> 04:24.840
So, Matthew, we don't have this event

04:24.840 --> 04:26.160
while identification.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.040
There is a payment that does not happen yet.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.520
So we don't have events by event,

04:34.520 --> 04:39.400
the split between paid and a bank, okay.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.400
But then, colleagues, I mean, you know, I will never...

04:42.400 --> 04:44.760
I mean, please don't get us wrong.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.680
We will never force you to use a system

04:46.680 --> 04:48.240
that you are not comfortable to use.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.320
Honestly, considering the situation

04:50.320 --> 04:53.200
and considering that we need to report by the end of the week,

04:53.200 --> 04:54.040
this is really...

04:54.040 --> 04:57.200
I mean, we need to go with what we use,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.880
what we feel is the best solution.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.240
The thing is, if you don't have it for the global transparency solution,

05:03.240 --> 05:06.160
you will not have it neither for in Excel, right?

05:06.160 --> 05:09.960
Or how do you plan to solve this?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.040
You see what I mean?

05:13.040 --> 05:13.920
You see what I mean?

05:13.920 --> 05:18.960
If you don't have an ACP and you don't have the accrual per events,

05:18.960 --> 05:21.240
even if you are not using the global transparency solution

05:21.240 --> 05:24.480
and you do the reporting manually, how will you do that?

05:25.960 --> 05:30.480
Okay, so the payment which has been happened in SAP

05:30.480 --> 05:33.440
that we can find out from SAP IBI.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.920
Now, the issue right now, what we are having,

05:35.920 --> 05:40.280
that those events which happen in February, March,

05:40.280 --> 05:44.640
their invoice are being posted in SAP,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.560
but that does not been paid

05:46.560 --> 05:48.200
because payment would happen

05:48.200 --> 05:52.720
basis the credit arms of the vendors.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.560
But received not invoiced.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.440
Yes.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.440
So if we can see, we may see our status in SAP

06:01.440 --> 06:04.600
as a post date or created or index,

06:04.600 --> 06:06.320
but not the paid.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.920
And that paid goes to SAP IBI.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.640
So those payments basis the SAP individual data,

06:14.640 --> 06:18.640
we have taken an account and factored for reporting,

06:18.640 --> 06:23.640
but those data is completely missed in this SAP IBI report.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.520
Probably in future, one, two months,

06:26.520 --> 06:30.760
probably two months down the line, we may get the data.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.240
So that is the reason, you know,

06:34.240 --> 06:38.920
the manual data captured all which are paid plus provision

06:38.920 --> 06:42.760
plus, you know, posted.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.760
Okay.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.800
Matthew, just to simplify,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.280
in be sure we've always captured the quotation

06:49.280 --> 06:51.920
as well as invoices, basis there,

06:51.920 --> 06:54.960
the tracking was already prepared by the third party,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.440
which captures against which event,

06:56.440 --> 06:58.880
which are the payments pending to be posted

06:58.920 --> 07:02.320
and which are already in the SAP.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.000
So we have that available,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.840
but it is just that we don't have a report

07:05.840 --> 07:07.440
which clearly by for case,

07:07.440 --> 07:10.280
what is paid and posted in SAP right now.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.440
So it was a manual effort that has enabled us to reconcile

07:15.560 --> 07:17.080
all of this, Matthew.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
Yeah.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.360
Yeah, Matthew.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.520
Yeah.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.040
And there were two other three,

07:22.040 --> 07:24.960
I mean, incidentals, but important.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.600
One, this is the first time, of course,

07:26.600 --> 07:30.440
India is coming under the Transparency Reporting Act

07:30.440 --> 07:34.680
and which means and also given whatever indications

07:34.680 --> 07:37.480
that we have, the multinational organizations

07:37.480 --> 07:39.680
are going to be under a lot more scrutiny

07:39.680 --> 07:41.600
than the local organizations are.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.920
They've already made an example of one of the multinational

07:45.920 --> 07:50.200
organizations a few months back on one of the breaches

07:51.120 --> 07:55.120
and all indications are that all multinational organizations

07:55.120 --> 07:58.000
are going to be under heavy scrutiny

07:58.000 --> 08:00.440
for at least the cycle, right?

08:00.440 --> 08:03.680
So so hence there has been a lot of reliance on

08:03.680 --> 08:06.600
what is going to be a uniform standard approach

08:06.600 --> 08:09.760
to reporting across the members,

08:09.760 --> 08:13.160
the member organizations of the association

08:14.120 --> 08:18.840
and we are having a uniform approach towards

08:18.840 --> 08:22.080
reporting some of these, right?

08:22.080 --> 08:25.000
So so we are being a lot more conservative

08:25.000 --> 08:29.200
and not aggressive and we are ensuring that

08:29.200 --> 08:31.520
even the ones which have been accrued

08:32.480 --> 08:36.000
and one spare services have been taken

08:36.000 --> 08:38.040
but payments will be made at a later stage

08:38.040 --> 08:39.240
that still will report it.

08:40.560 --> 08:43.280
There is a provision where we have

08:45.280 --> 08:50.120
used disclaimers and we've also put in those comments

08:50.120 --> 08:52.640
but not exhaustive limited comments

08:52.680 --> 08:55.920
just to ensure that some of the clarity could be

08:55.920 --> 08:57.960
provided towards some of these items.

08:57.960 --> 09:02.520
So hence the concern on how we really show up

09:02.520 --> 09:03.960
in the first year of reporting.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.520
But I've been asked then, are you telling me

09:06.520 --> 09:11.760
that you already have done the data collection, right?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.040
For what you believe should be disclosed

09:14.040 --> 09:15.200
by the end of this week.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.080
You have for the truly guarantees.

09:20.080 --> 09:20.920
Yeah.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.080
I mean,

09:25.080 --> 09:28.040
so what is the question today?

09:28.040 --> 09:30.560
Is it, are you asking for an exemption

09:30.560 --> 09:32.760
to use the global solution and the global end

09:32.760 --> 09:34.160
to follow the global process?

09:36.320 --> 09:37.800
No, that's the internal Matthew.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.560
Just to bring you over.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.800
Thank you.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.640
Thank you.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.560
That is from the country is to go with the manual

09:44.560 --> 09:48.640
disclosure, not for the standard global

09:48.640 --> 09:51.520
transparency solution because very simply implemented.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.600
I'm absolutely, but for me it's fine.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.440
Absolutely.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.960
I mean, I will never prevent you to do what you feel

09:57.960 --> 09:58.920
it's best for you.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.080
We are no one to say they were.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.680
I mean, I feel it's a little bit ashamed

10:02.680 --> 10:05.160
that the teams spend so much effort to implement.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.360
I don't know exactly if we missed something

10:07.360 --> 10:11.920
in the business requirements or if we did not

10:11.920 --> 10:13.640
enough listen to you.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.800
But obviously if you have the report really

10:16.800 --> 10:19.800
in with the manual data collection

10:19.800 --> 10:21.760
and you feel comfortable with the figures,

10:21.760 --> 10:24.320
you should report that you have definitively.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.880
I mean, I don't know.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.560
I mean, actually, it's what you were asking for more.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.640
That was the, that was the ask, Matthew.

10:30.640 --> 10:35.760
And also there were a couple of other evolving

10:35.760 --> 10:36.440
situations.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.280
The other evolving situation was one of the

10:40.280 --> 10:43.320
East signatories to the transparency report

10:43.320 --> 10:45.320
was the country president.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.960
And the country president would have

10:47.960 --> 10:50.680
to record his signature on the report

10:50.680 --> 10:53.080
before the report is presented.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.160
And he was also traveling.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.240
So he's currently out of the country.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.360
So before he moved out of the country

11:01.360 --> 11:06.200
or official business, we had to kind of see the report

11:06.200 --> 11:10.840
and be comfortable with what was captured in the report.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.560
So if, and those were the pieces.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.960
And of course, all of this was in accordance

11:16.040 --> 11:22.200
in line with how the association guided us.

11:22.200 --> 11:26.400
And what was the directive in terms of how

11:26.400 --> 11:28.080
it had to be presented.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.160
So those were the things.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.800
So of course, Wade in also very heavily.

11:33.800 --> 11:38.640
And hence the ask and the request from our side.

11:38.640 --> 11:43.200
I mean, no, no, so let's go apparently you're already

11:43.200 --> 11:44.960
you're done with the reporting.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.040
So let's continue what you've initiated.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.840
Just first of all, and I hope let's be,

11:51.840 --> 11:53.640
let's speak honestly and transparently

11:53.640 --> 11:55.280
even if the team is on the phone today.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.840
But do you feel that we as a global transparency team,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.840
we miss something about your requirements.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.080
And using that, there was a miss during the project

12:04.080 --> 12:09.080
that we explaining why we are facing this situation today.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.320
Matthew, I'm really sorry.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.400
I don't have the historical reference

12:12.400 --> 12:14.840
because I got into the role six months back.

12:15.800 --> 12:25.400
And I'm just carrying the work that was already underway.

12:25.400 --> 12:30.760
So I'm not really sure of what conversations have happened

12:30.760 --> 12:32.160
before.

12:32.160 --> 12:32.920
I'm really sorry.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.200
I'm not able to throw much light on that.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.200
OK, maybe satish one last question.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.400
And then I ended up to you.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.240
So all the nation and the Russian

12:43.240 --> 12:46.320
they are, are you comfortable also?

12:46.320 --> 12:49.800
And can we say that even if this one is done manually?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.120
First, we would need to, if this is OK with you,

12:52.120 --> 12:54.600
we would need to load the data into the global transparency

12:54.600 --> 12:58.280
solution because for internal analytics purpose,

12:58.280 --> 13:00.400
we need to have a full view of the total transfer

13:00.400 --> 13:04.400
of values for the company because we are presenting, for example,

13:04.400 --> 13:06.240
to Patrick Harper on Monday.

13:06.240 --> 13:10.480
And he wants to see the entire, the entire tier of this.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.920
But this one and they were so more importantly

13:14.920 --> 13:17.280
because this one is just for internal analytics.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.040
But more importantly, are you comfortable

13:19.040 --> 13:22.320
that for the, I mean, are you OK, sorry?

13:22.320 --> 13:24.800
That for the future, we will really understand

13:24.800 --> 13:30.160
what, how we should address the issues

13:30.160 --> 13:33.240
and moving forward, find a solution for you

13:33.240 --> 13:35.720
to get the data directly from the global solution

13:35.720 --> 13:39.000
because colleagues, these should save significant time

13:39.000 --> 13:39.960
from you, right?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.280
And so sorry that you spent so much time

13:42.280 --> 13:44.640
on transparency, but I think in the future,

13:44.640 --> 13:46.320
we should be able to provide you something

13:46.320 --> 13:48.560
that you are mostly comfortable with.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.000
And you just review and sign off if you agree with you.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.600
OK, absolutely, not absolutely, Matthew.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.600
And I think that's the whole idea.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.800
And we would definitely going forward,

14:01.800 --> 14:05.520
like to rely on the global transparency tool.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.200
And we need to find some solutions to some of these challenges

14:09.200 --> 14:13.640
that we have enough in our systems today.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.680
And how do we really overcome that?

14:17.680 --> 14:20.280
But we're really looking up to you

14:20.280 --> 14:22.840
to help us find solutions.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.320
But that's clearly the intent.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.960
I would really want to ask, you know what,

14:27.960 --> 14:29.840
what do we also want to kind of share?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.520
What's our finding of the reporting?

14:32.520 --> 14:34.560
And how our format looks like and what

14:34.560 --> 14:37.800
does it that you want to share with them?

14:37.800 --> 14:40.200
In the current UCP API report, how is it?

14:40.200 --> 14:43.000
Do you want to share that data also with them?

14:43.000 --> 14:47.600
So we have actually had that format ready.

14:47.600 --> 14:52.680
We passed the way UCPMP asked us to report it

14:52.680 --> 14:57.520
with the total amount and total aggregate level.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.200
So and we got this data from the backup data

15:02.200 --> 15:09.200
where we have the spin under different spin here.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.560
So we are very specific data set

15:13.560 --> 15:17.000
for speaker fees, render fees, and also it gives

15:17.000 --> 15:23.400
a complete visibility how that total data is coming for.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.880
So we have the backup data and from there,

15:25.880 --> 15:29.880
we have generated the report.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.760
OK.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.680
So we will load your report into the global transparency

15:33.680 --> 15:36.040
solution, right?

15:36.040 --> 15:38.160
Afterwards, once you've published, we

15:38.160 --> 15:41.920
will take your data and we will load that into the global

15:41.920 --> 15:43.960
transparency search.

15:43.960 --> 15:48.400
So Matthew, do you mean to say that once this posted entries

15:48.400 --> 15:53.520
or posted SAP line items are reaching in the SAP IBI?

15:53.520 --> 15:54.320
That's when we do it?

15:58.560 --> 16:00.160
I need to discuss with the team because you

16:00.160 --> 16:01.560
are absolutely right, sorry.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.920
We already have access to the data, right?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.840
Because we already have the interface with SAP.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.200
So we don't need to reload your Excel file.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.240
We have the data.

16:09.240 --> 16:13.680
OK, now forget about what I said and forget about what I said.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.120
No, the only question math would be on the RCF control

16:17.120 --> 16:17.680
colleagues.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.920
So there are like six, so now it's nine.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.200
We increase to nine.

16:22.200 --> 16:29.840
We have nine RCF controls that we need to execute on the countries

16:29.840 --> 16:32.400
scope of transparency reporting.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.040
And so we need to see how we do that without you

16:36.040 --> 16:37.960
following the global process.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.720
But it's manageable.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.200
We do it with the data.
