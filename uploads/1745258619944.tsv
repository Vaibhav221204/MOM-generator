0	10000	Hello everyone!
10000	17960	Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get
17960	19960	started.
19960	25720	Jason, can you please take the minutes today?
25720	29000	Yes, of course, Tony.
29000	32000	No problem.
32000	33000	Thanks.
33000	38120	Okay, let's get the ball rolling.
38120	45840	First on the agenda today, Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing
45840	51000	strategy for our new beverage, ginger cola?
51000	53000	Yes, Tony.
53000	62000	Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola as a health and energy drink.
62000	65000	Fantastic.
65000	69440	I think this will be our next big hit.
69440	74160	There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.
74160	76880	It tastes great.
76880	79160	It's healthy.
79160	82880	And it has very low calories.
82880	86640	It's perfect for working out.
86640	91520	Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.
91520	97080	Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?
97080	105320	We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter from
105320	110280	the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.
110280	118320	We still have to iron out some details, but we think he's a great fit.
118320	119640	Great idea.
119640	128280	Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you
128280	130480	have planned.
130480	138280	Of course, that's really important, but we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.
138280	141120	Okay, Tony.
141120	145920	I will be ready to present to everyone then.
145920	149280	Let's move on to the next topic.
149280	155400	I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.
155400	163760	It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming
163760	167240	charity Walkathon.
167240	173520	Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.
173520	177200	This is extremely important for us.
177200	181000	We need to give back to the community.
181000	184600	I couldn't agree more.
184600	191840	This has been at the top of all our agendas, and we have come up with some pretty innovative
191840	194200	ideas.
194200	196600	Let me start things off.
196600	198600	If that's okay with everyone else...
