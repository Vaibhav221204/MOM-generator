0	4520	So we are taking it from SAP only.
4520	5320	Then we are good.
7840	13480	So I need the, I mean, this I would effectively
13480	17080	be in favor to use the global transparency solution
17080	19480	for the reporting of one of the legal entities,
19480	23680	but I really want the local compliance team
23680	27000	to be comfortable with that.
27720	31320	So Matthew, really, the challenge is here on the second point.
31320	35480	The legal entity we already discussed earlier with Rashi.
35480	37920	And there was a work around that they proposed right now,
37920	39920	which we could have worked.
39920	42080	But challenge really is the second point
42080	45880	where we would have to capture the posting data as well,
45880	48480	which is not there currently in the SAP IPA report.
48480	50960	So that means we will have a missing data coming
50960	52680	in the IPA report.
52680	54280	OK.
54280	57120	Just on this front, I don't.
57120	60560	So this is very different.
60560	63160	Usually transparency reporting is based on payment.
63160	68200	So we are disclosing what Novartis effectively
68200	72840	give to HCPs, HCOs, and patient organizations.
72840	75640	What I'm trying to understand is, are we sure
75640	79000	that this is the regulatory requirement
79000	84040	to disclose at an event level and not at payment level?
84040	85520	Because this is very new to me.
85520	88600	We don't have such situation in any of the 50
88600	91000	plus countries that we are managing.
91000	93240	So Matthew, you're absolutely correct.
93240	96040	So Novartis, not Novartis, India
96040	99120	has got a pre-unique regulatory requirement
99120	103520	which requires the pharmaceutical organizations
103520	106440	to report at the event level, which
106440	112040	means once an event happens and the provisions are made.
112040	118600	So the postings that happens through the financial reporting
118600	121520	needs to be captured.
121520	123600	And this clarification has been
123600	127800	grow, has been received through the industry association
127800	132640	and also through the Department of Pharmaceuticals
132640	134720	for India.
134720	137280	So this is a directive that we've...
137280	141400	So what happens is, March 31st is the annual year
142240	146280	so events that happen the last week or in the month,
146280	149840	depending on the contract of the vendors,
149840	153440	the payment will not get processed in time,
153440	155280	but it will get provisioned.
155280	159680	And if it gets provisioned, it can still be posted.
159680	160680	Yeah.
160680	162840	The payment can happen at a later stage.
162840	164600	So that needs to be...
164600	169000	And because the event has happened within the fiscal year,
169000	171920	it needs to be captured in the report.
171920	173480	Nice images.
173480	174720	OK.
174720	178440	But so...
178440	182920	And we have a clear view on what has been accrued
182920	190320	as of March 31st that needs to be reported
190320	192680	to we have a clear visibility on the accords.
192680	193480	Really?
193480	194280	Absolutely.
194280	196080	Absolutely, yes.
196080	197080	Yeah.
197080	199640	I know that there are payment that are posted,
199640	202960	which have to be considered for the purpose of reporting.
202960	205160	But if you are asking clear visibility,
205160	209120	as in we don't have that split between what is the exact payment
209120	211160	that needs to be...
211160	213320	That is in the posting case state.
213320	216000	Because that keeps on changing a week after week.
219040	220720	Can you repeat this last sentence?
220720	222520	I'll teach you the issue of the...
222520	223560	So if you have the accords...
223560	227440	Let's assume you have an event of 100.
227440	231200	60 has been already invoiced as of March 1st,
231200	232200	so it's in...
232200	234480	And it has been paid, sorry, as in paid.
234480	236280	So it's already in ACP.
236280	238200	You have 40.
238200	240560	You know that the service has been executed,
240560	243400	so you have 40 that has been accrued.
243400	247360	But by March 31st, this has not been paid.
247360	249720	But those 40, if I understand well the rule
249720	253480	that we have in India, those 40 needs to be reflected.
253760	256480	But with the accords that have been done,
256480	259240	we should be able to link the accrued amount
259240	260840	with the event, no?
263160	264840	So, Matthew, we don't have this event
264840	266160	while identification.
267200	269040	There is a payment that does not happen yet.
272320	274520	So we don't have events by event,
274520	279400	the split between paid and a bank, okay.
279400	282400	But then, colleagues, I mean, you know, I will never...
282400	284760	I mean, please don't get us wrong.
284760	286680	We will never force you to use a system
286680	288240	that you are not comfortable to use.
288240	290320	Honestly, considering the situation
290320	293200	and considering that we need to report by the end of the week,
293200	294040	this is really...
294040	297200	I mean, we need to go with what we use,
297200	299880	what we feel is the best solution.
299880	303240	The thing is, if you don't have it for the global transparency solution,
303240	306160	you will not have it neither for in Excel, right?
306160	309960	Or how do you plan to solve this?
310960	313040	You see what I mean?
313040	313920	You see what I mean?
313920	318960	If you don't have an ACP and you don't have the accrual per events,
318960	321240	even if you are not using the global transparency solution
321240	324480	and you do the reporting manually, how will you do that?
325960	330480	Okay, so the payment which has been happened in SAP
330480	333440	that we can find out from SAP IBI.
333440	335920	Now, the issue right now, what we are having,
335920	340280	that those events which happen in February, March,
340280	344640	their invoice are being posted in SAP,
344640	346560	but that does not been paid
346560	348200	because payment would happen
348200	352720	basis the credit arms of the vendors.
352720	355560	But received not invoiced.
355560	356440	Yes.
356440	361440	So if we can see, we may see our status in SAP
361440	364600	as a post date or created or index,
364600	366320	but not the paid.
366320	369920	And that paid goes to SAP IBI.
369920	374640	So those payments basis the SAP individual data,
374640	378640	we have taken an account and factored for reporting,
378640	383640	but those data is completely missed in this SAP IBI report.
383640	386520	Probably in future, one, two months,
386520	390760	probably two months down the line, we may get the data.
390760	394240	So that is the reason, you know,
394240	398920	the manual data captured all which are paid plus provision
398920	402760	plus, you know, posted.
402760	404760	Okay.
404760	406800	Matthew, just to simplify,
406800	409280	in be sure we've always captured the quotation
409280	411920	as well as invoices, basis there,
411920	414960	the tracking was already prepared by the third party,
414960	416440	which captures against which event,
416440	418880	which are the payments pending to be posted
418920	422320	and which are already in the SAP.
422320	424000	So we have that available,
424000	425840	but it is just that we don't have a report
425840	427440	which clearly by for case,
427440	430280	what is paid and posted in SAP right now.
430280	434440	So it was a manual effort that has enabled us to reconcile
435560	437080	all of this, Matthew.
437080	438080	Yeah.
438080	439360	Yeah, Matthew.
439360	440520	Yeah.
440520	442040	And there were two other three,
442040	444960	I mean, incidentals, but important.
444960	446600	One, this is the first time, of course,
446600	450440	India is coming under the Transparency Reporting Act
450440	454680	and which means and also given whatever indications
454680	457480	that we have, the multinational organizations
457480	459680	are going to be under a lot more scrutiny
459680	461600	than the local organizations are.
462760	465920	They've already made an example of one of the multinational
465920	470200	organizations a few months back on one of the breaches
471120	475120	and all indications are that all multinational organizations
475120	478000	are going to be under heavy scrutiny
478000	480440	for at least the cycle, right?
480440	483680	So so hence there has been a lot of reliance on
483680	486600	what is going to be a uniform standard approach
486600	489760	to reporting across the members,
489760	493160	the member organizations of the association
494120	498840	and we are having a uniform approach towards
498840	502080	reporting some of these, right?
502080	505000	So so we are being a lot more conservative
505000	509200	and not aggressive and we are ensuring that
509200	511520	even the ones which have been accrued
512480	516000	and one spare services have been taken
516000	518040	but payments will be made at a later stage
518040	519240	that still will report it.
520560	523280	There is a provision where we have
525280	530120	used disclaimers and we've also put in those comments
530120	532640	but not exhaustive limited comments
532680	535920	just to ensure that some of the clarity could be
535920	537960	provided towards some of these items.
537960	542520	So hence the concern on how we really show up
542520	543960	in the first year of reporting.
545000	546520	But I've been asked then, are you telling me
546520	551760	that you already have done the data collection, right?
551760	554040	For what you believe should be disclosed
554040	555200	by the end of this week.
556760	560080	You have for the truly guarantees.
560080	560920	Yeah.
563640	565080	I mean,
565080	568040	so what is the question today?
568040	570560	Is it, are you asking for an exemption
570560	572760	to use the global solution and the global end
572760	574160	to follow the global process?
576320	577800	No, that's the internal Matthew.
577800	579560	Just to bring you over.
579560	580800	Thank you.
580800	581640	Thank you.
581640	584560	That is from the country is to go with the manual
584560	588640	disclosure, not for the standard global
588640	591520	transparency solution because very simply implemented.
591520	594600	I'm absolutely, but for me it's fine.
594600	595440	Absolutely.
595440	597960	I mean, I will never prevent you to do what you feel
597960	598920	it's best for you.
598920	601080	We are no one to say they were.
601080	602680	I mean, I feel it's a little bit ashamed
602680	605160	that the teams spend so much effort to implement.
605160	607360	I don't know exactly if we missed something
607360	611920	in the business requirements or if we did not
611920	613640	enough listen to you.
613640	616800	But obviously if you have the report really
616800	619800	in with the manual data collection
619800	621760	and you feel comfortable with the figures,
621760	624320	you should report that you have definitively.
624320	625880	I mean, I don't know.
625880	628560	I mean, actually, it's what you were asking for more.
628560	630640	That was the, that was the ask, Matthew.
630640	635760	And also there were a couple of other evolving
635760	636440	situations.
636440	640280	The other evolving situation was one of the
640280	643320	East signatories to the transparency report
643320	645320	was the country president.
645320	647960	And the country president would have
647960	650680	to record his signature on the report
650680	653080	before the report is presented.
653080	655160	And he was also traveling.
655160	658240	So he's currently out of the country.
658240	661360	So before he moved out of the country
661360	666200	or official business, we had to kind of see the report
666200	670840	and be comfortable with what was captured in the report.
670840	673560	So if, and those were the pieces.
673560	675960	And of course, all of this was in accordance
676040	682200	in line with how the association guided us.
682200	686400	And what was the directive in terms of how
686400	688080	it had to be presented.
688080	689160	So those were the things.
689160	693800	So of course, Wade in also very heavily.
693800	698640	And hence the ask and the request from our side.
698640	703200	I mean, no, no, so let's go apparently you're already
703200	704960	you're done with the reporting.
704960	707040	So let's continue what you've initiated.
707040	711840	Just first of all, and I hope let's be,
711840	713640	let's speak honestly and transparently
713640	715280	even if the team is on the phone today.
715280	718840	But do you feel that we as a global transparency team,
718840	720840	we miss something about your requirements.
720840	724080	And using that, there was a miss during the project
724080	729080	that we explaining why we are facing this situation today.
729080	730320	Matthew, I'm really sorry.
730320	732400	I don't have the historical reference
732400	734840	because I got into the role six months back.
735800	745400	And I'm just carrying the work that was already underway.
745400	750760	So I'm not really sure of what conversations have happened
750760	752160	before.
752160	752920	I'm really sorry.
752920	756200	I'm not able to throw much light on that.
756200	758200	OK, maybe satish one last question.
758200	759400	And then I ended up to you.
759400	763240	So all the nation and the Russian
763240	766320	they are, are you comfortable also?
766320	769800	And can we say that even if this one is done manually?
769800	772120	First, we would need to, if this is OK with you,
772120	774600	we would need to load the data into the global transparency
774600	778280	solution because for internal analytics purpose,
778280	780400	we need to have a full view of the total transfer
780400	784400	of values for the company because we are presenting, for example,
784400	786240	to Patrick Harper on Monday.
786240	790480	And he wants to see the entire, the entire tier of this.
790480	794920	But this one and they were so more importantly
794920	797280	because this one is just for internal analytics.
797280	799040	But more importantly, are you comfortable
799040	802320	that for the, I mean, are you OK, sorry?
802320	804800	That for the future, we will really understand
804800	810160	what, how we should address the issues
810160	813240	and moving forward, find a solution for you
813240	815720	to get the data directly from the global solution
815720	819000	because colleagues, these should save significant time
819000	819960	from you, right?
819960	822280	And so sorry that you spent so much time
822280	824640	on transparency, but I think in the future,
824640	826320	we should be able to provide you something
826320	828560	that you are mostly comfortable with.
828560	833000	And you just review and sign off if you agree with you.
833000	835600	OK, absolutely, not absolutely, Matthew.
835600	837600	And I think that's the whole idea.
837600	841800	And we would definitely going forward,
841800	845520	like to rely on the global transparency tool.
845600	849200	And we need to find some solutions to some of these challenges
849200	853640	that we have enough in our systems today.
853640	857680	And how do we really overcome that?
857680	860280	But we're really looking up to you
860280	862840	to help us find solutions.
862840	866320	But that's clearly the intent.
866320	867960	I would really want to ask, you know what,
867960	869840	what do we also want to kind of share?
869840	872520	What's our finding of the reporting?
872520	874560	And how our format looks like and what
874560	877800	does it that you want to share with them?
877800	880200	In the current UCP API report, how is it?
880200	883000	Do you want to share that data also with them?
883000	887600	So we have actually had that format ready.
887600	892680	We passed the way UCPMP asked us to report it
892680	897520	with the total amount and total aggregate level.
897520	902200	So and we got this data from the backup data
902200	909200	where we have the spin under different spin here.
909200	913560	So we are very specific data set
913560	917000	for speaker fees, render fees, and also it gives
917000	923400	a complete visibility how that total data is coming for.
923400	925880	So we have the backup data and from there,
925880	929880	we have generated the report.
929880	930760	OK.
930760	933680	So we will load your report into the global transparency
933680	936040	solution, right?
936040	938160	Afterwards, once you've published, we
938160	941920	will take your data and we will load that into the global
941920	943960	transparency search.
943960	948400	So Matthew, do you mean to say that once this posted entries
948400	953520	or posted SAP line items are reaching in the SAP IBI?
953520	954320	That's when we do it?
958560	960160	I need to discuss with the team because you
960160	961560	are absolutely right, sorry.
961560	963920	We already have access to the data, right?
963920	965840	Because we already have the interface with SAP.
965840	968200	So we don't need to reload your Excel file.
