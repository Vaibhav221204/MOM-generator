WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
fancy process and the global transparency reporting.

00:03.280 --> 00:08.320
We do it at entity, at legal entity level.

00:08.320 --> 00:14.320
To why during the project, we wanted to have one combined report

00:14.320 --> 00:16.080
for two legal entities.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.000
What was the rationale behind would you

00:18.000 --> 00:23.800
know that Felix, do you know Rashid?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.200
So for India, we have two company codes.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.400
Ion01 and Ion10.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.320
So now we have been tracking all the payment information,

00:33.320 --> 00:35.640
even when India was an internal market.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.000
We have been using both the company codes

00:38.000 --> 00:43.240
and tracking the details in GTC for both of these company

00:43.240 --> 00:43.960
codes.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.360
We were not sure that these two are two separate legal entities,

00:49.360 --> 00:50.240
so to say.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.920
So this was observed very recently, Matthew,

00:53.920 --> 00:56.560
when we were going to prepare the idea report,

00:56.560 --> 00:57.280
that is very important.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.880
I understand that the details.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.760
So Rashid, if I understand what you're saying

01:01.760 --> 01:03.720
is that there was not a conscious decision

01:03.720 --> 01:06.800
from the global transparency team to merge two legal entities

01:06.800 --> 01:10.600
to one, it's just that we didn't know, right?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.000
OK.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.840
Now, the thing is that then the system has

01:16.840 --> 01:21.160
been set up only for, has been linked to only one legal entity,

01:21.160 --> 01:24.280
not the two of them.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.280
Is that correct, Rashid?

01:25.280 --> 01:27.320
We are uploading data for both.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.960
There is no segregation, but we are uploading data

01:29.960 --> 01:30.800
for both of these.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.680
But for ITR, you would need then two ITR entries

01:35.680 --> 01:36.880
for the two legal entities.

01:36.880 --> 01:37.200
Yes.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.200
Right now, we have a combined report for both

01:39.200 --> 01:42.000
where there is no segregation basis the legal entity.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.600
OK.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.040
And do we know what the local codes say in India?

01:47.040 --> 01:50.200
Do they say one reporting per legal entity?

01:50.200 --> 01:51.920
Is it legal requirements?

01:51.920 --> 01:54.320
I mean, at least a regular requirement.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.320
It is with you.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.520
It needs to.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.840
Yeah, it is.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.680
Because the other entity, which is the Novartis India

02:05.680 --> 02:09.040
Limited, is the listed entity.

02:09.040 --> 02:11.680
It's listed on the stock exchange.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.840
And that needs to be disclosed separately.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.240
OK.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.480
And I think then the answer is pretty simple, right?

02:21.480 --> 02:25.120
So what is the deadline for the reporting?

02:25.120 --> 02:27.480
I understand it's in a week time.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.360
It's end of May.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.920
This weekend, I would say, target.

02:31.920 --> 02:32.720
OK.

02:32.720 --> 02:38.800
So there is no chance that with IQVA, we can set up the ITR

02:38.800 --> 02:40.240
for the missing legal entities.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.240
Is it a statistic?

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
I don't think so, Matthew.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.520
But what we can do is one option is we can generate

02:47.520 --> 02:51.320
at least one report with the maximum major values

02:51.320 --> 02:56.440
and invalidate some of the spends for other legal entities.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.360
OK.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.040
Yes, definitely.

02:59.040 --> 03:05.920
It's one possibility that we do Novartis LSCAR LTT

03:05.920 --> 03:07.680
with ITR.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.240
The only risk that we have is the duplicating,

03:11.240 --> 03:14.200
the duplicate reporting, because there might be

03:14.200 --> 03:19.240
how will you split the TEOVs per legal entity?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.880
You see what I mean?

03:20.880 --> 03:24.440
Satish is that there is a risk that we report some of the TEOVs

03:24.440 --> 03:27.640
that are linked to Novartis India LTT,

03:27.640 --> 03:31.120
meaning that when they will do the manual reporting

03:31.120 --> 03:35.760
in Excel or whatever, there might be some duplicating TEOVs there.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.400
No, we have that segregation at SAP level,

03:38.400 --> 03:39.960
because we are using that data.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.400
We have that segregation at the end.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.360
So this is my understanding, Matthew.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.200
We can generate one report.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.520
So we can look at the maximum line items and maximum volume.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.440
And if the volume with Novartis India limited is less,

03:56.440 --> 04:00.760
then we can invalidate them and still generate a ITR report.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.760
OK, so we can manually do that.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.280
So for that expense, it's just one less question

04:05.280 --> 04:06.200
before we take a decision.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.560
So for that expense is clear, and I understand

04:08.560 --> 04:12.360
there is no risk of duplication for indirect spend colleagues.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.720
How do we make the split between the TEOVs?

04:14.720 --> 04:17.960
For us, the source of data is only SAP Matthew.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.840
There is no other indirect also.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.680
We are taking it from SAP only.

04:22.680 --> 04:23.520
Then we are good.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.760
So I need this.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.640
I would effectively be in favor to use the global transparency

04:34.640 --> 04:37.640
solution for the reporting of one of the TEOVs,

04:37.640 --> 04:41.840
but I really want the local compliance team

04:41.840 --> 04:45.160
to be comfortable with that.

04:45.160 --> 04:45.920
Perfect.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.480
So Matthew, really the challenge is here on the second point.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.760
Product is pretty quickly.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.640
We already discussed earlier with Rashi.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.080
And there was a work around that they proposed right now,

04:56.080 --> 04:58.080
which we could have worked.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.240
But challenge really is the second point

05:00.240 --> 05:04.040
where we would have to capture the posting data as well,

05:04.040 --> 05:06.640
which is not there currently in the SAP I bear report.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.800
So that means we will have a missing data coming in the ITR report.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.600
OK.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.280
Just on this front, I don't.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.720
So this is very different.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.320
Usually transparency reporting is based on payment.

05:21.320 --> 05:26.360
So we are disclosing what Novartis effectively

05:26.360 --> 05:30.960
give to HTTP's, HEO's, and patient organizations.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.200
What I'm trying to understand is, is it

05:33.200 --> 05:37.160
are we sure that this is the regulatory requirement

05:37.160 --> 05:42.240
to disclose at an event level and not at payment level,

05:42.240 --> 05:43.680
because this is very new to me.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.720
We don't have such situation in any of the 50

05:46.720 --> 05:49.160
pressed countries that we are managing.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.400
So Matthew, you're absolutely correct.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.200
So Novartis, so not Novartis, India

05:54.200 --> 05:57.280
has got a pretty unique regulatory requirement,

05:57.280 --> 06:01.680
which requires the pharmaceutical organizations

06:01.680 --> 06:04.600
to report at the event level, which

06:04.600 --> 06:10.200
means once an event happens and the provisions are made,

06:10.200 --> 06:16.760
so the postings that happens through the financial reporting

06:16.760 --> 06:19.440
needs to be captured.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.800
And this clarification has been

06:21.800 --> 06:25.960
grow, has been received through the industry association,

06:25.960 --> 06:30.800
and also through the Department of Pharmaceuticals

06:30.800 --> 06:32.920
for India.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.480
So this is a directive that we've,

06:35.480 --> 06:40.480
so what happens is for March 31st is the annual year end.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.520
So events that happen the last week or in the month,

06:44.520 --> 06:48.040
depending on the contact of the vendors,

06:48.040 --> 06:51.640
the payment will not get processed in time,

06:51.640 --> 06:53.520
but it will get provisioned.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.040
And if it gets provisioned, it can still be posted.

06:58.040 --> 06:58.880
Yeah.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.080
Payment can happen at a later stage.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.880
So that needs to be, and because the event

07:03.880 --> 07:07.240
has happened within the fiscal year,

07:07.240 --> 07:10.160
it needs to be captured in the report.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.720
Nice images.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.960
OK.

07:12.960 --> 07:19.200
But so, and we have a clear view on what

07:19.200 --> 07:25.680
has been accrued as of March 31st, that the net needs,

07:25.680 --> 07:28.600
sorry, that they need to be reported.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.920
Do we have a clear visibility on the accords?

07:30.920 --> 07:31.760
Absolutely.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.560
There was absolutely, yes.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.960
So Matthew, we know that there are payments that are posted,

07:36.960 --> 07:41.000
which have to be considered for the purpose of reporting.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.080
But if you are asking clear visibility,

07:43.080 --> 07:47.200
I think we don't have that split between what is the exact payment

07:47.200 --> 07:51.400
that needs to be, that is in the posting case state,

07:51.400 --> 07:54.000
because that keeps on changing a week after week.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.840
Can you repeat this last sentence?

07:58.840 --> 08:01.600
I'll teach you the issue of the issue of the issue of the accords.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.680
So let's assume you have an event of 100.

08:05.680 --> 08:09.440
60 has been already invoiced as of March 1st,

08:09.440 --> 08:12.680
so it's in an L has been paid, sorry, as in paid.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.480
So it's already in ACP.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.400
You have 40.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.760
You know that the service has been executed,

08:18.760 --> 08:21.600
so you have 40 that has been accrued.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.560
But by March 31st, this has not been paid.

08:25.560 --> 08:29.240
But those 40, if I understand well the whole that we have in India,

08:29.240 --> 08:31.880
those 40 needs to be reflected.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.640
But with the accords that have been done,

08:34.640 --> 08:38.520
we should be able to link the accrued amount with the event.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.200
No?

08:41.200 --> 08:45.320
So Matthew, we don't have this event while identification.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.200
There is a payment that does not happen yet.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.680
So we don't have even spy event,

08:52.680 --> 08:57.560
the split between paid and accrued.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.880
But then colleagues, I mean, please don't get us wrong.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.840
We will never force you to use a system

09:04.840 --> 09:06.360
that you are not comfortable to use.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.480
Honestly, considering the situation

09:08.480 --> 09:11.320
and considering that we need to report by the end of the week,

09:11.320 --> 09:15.240
this is really, we need to go with what we use,

09:15.240 --> 09:18.000
what we feel is the best solution.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.360
The thing is, if you don't have it for the global transparency solution,

09:21.360 --> 09:24.280
you will not have it neither for in Excel, right?

09:24.280 --> 09:29.920
So how do you plan to solve this?

09:29.920 --> 09:31.280
You see what I mean?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.160
You see what I mean?

09:32.160 --> 09:37.200
If you don't have an ACP and you don't have the accrual pair events,

09:37.200 --> 09:39.440
even if you are not using the global transparency solution

09:39.440 --> 09:44.240
and you do the reporting manually, how will you do that?

09:44.240 --> 09:48.720
OK, so the payment which has been happened in SAP

09:48.720 --> 09:51.640
that we can find out from SAP IBI.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.120
Now, the issue right now, what we are having

09:54.120 --> 09:58.480
that those events which happened in February, March,

09:58.480 --> 10:02.840
their invoice have been posted in SAP,

10:02.840 --> 10:05.600
but that does not been paid because payment

10:05.600 --> 10:10.920
would happen basis the credit arms of the vendors.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.760
So it received not invoiced?

10:13.760 --> 10:14.640
Yes.

10:14.640 --> 10:19.640
So if we can see, we may see our status in SAP

10:19.640 --> 10:24.520
as a post date or created or index, but not the paid.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.120
And that paid goes to SAP IBI.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.840
So those payments basis the SAP individual data.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.840
We have taken an account and factored for reporting,

10:36.840 --> 10:41.840
but those data is completely missed in this SAP IBI, IBI report.

10:41.840 --> 10:46.120
Probably in future, one, two months, probably two months

10:46.120 --> 10:48.960
down the line, we may get the data.

10:48.960 --> 10:54.040
So that is the reason, the manual data captured,

10:54.040 --> 11:02.880
all which are paid plus provision plus a post date.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.960
I'm happy just to simplify.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.480
In Be sure, we always capture the quotation

11:07.480 --> 11:09.120
as well as invoices.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.640
The basis there, the tracking was already prepared

11:11.640 --> 11:14.680
by the third party, which captures against which event,

11:14.680 --> 11:17.120
which are the payments pending to be posted

11:17.120 --> 11:20.520
and which are already in the SAP.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.760
So we have that available, but it is just

11:22.760 --> 11:25.000
that we don't have a report which clearly

11:25.000 --> 11:28.480
by for case, what is paid and posted in SAP right now.

11:28.480 --> 11:33.720
So it was a manual of what that has enabled us to reconcile

11:33.720 --> 11:34.640
all of this.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.240
Mathya.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.000
Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.560
Yeah, Mathya.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.600
Yeah.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.000
And there were two other three, I mean,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.120
incidentals, but important.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.160
One, this is the first time, of course, India

11:45.160 --> 11:48.560
is coming under the Transparency Reporting Act,

11:48.560 --> 11:52.840
and which means, and also given whatever indications

11:52.840 --> 11:55.640
that we have, the multinational organizations

11:55.640 --> 11:57.840
are going to be under a lot more scrutiny

11:57.840 --> 12:00.880
than the local organizations are.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.280
They've already made an example of one

12:03.280 --> 12:07.040
of the multinational organizations a few months back

12:07.040 --> 12:09.280
on one of the breaches.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.280
And all indications are that all multinational organizations

12:13.280 --> 12:16.200
are going to be under heavy scrutiny

12:16.200 --> 12:18.640
for at least the cycle, right?

12:18.640 --> 12:22.040
So hence, there has been a lot of reliance on what

12:22.040 --> 12:26.160
is going to be a uniform standard approach to reporting

12:26.160 --> 12:30.120
across the members, the member organizations

12:30.120 --> 12:32.280
of the association.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.840
And we are having a uniform approach

12:35.840 --> 12:40.240
towards reporting some of these, right?

12:40.240 --> 12:44.800
So we are being a lot more conservative and not aggressive.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.440
And we are ensuring that even the ones

12:48.440 --> 12:53.200
which have been accrued, and one spare services have been

12:53.200 --> 12:56.200
taken, but payments will be made at a later stage.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.720
They'll still be reported.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.520
There is a provision where we have,

13:03.240 --> 13:05.840
used disclaimers.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.280
And we have also put in those comments,

13:08.280 --> 13:10.800
but not exhaustive, limited comments,

13:10.800 --> 13:14.080
just to ensure that some of the clarity could be

13:14.080 --> 13:16.080
provided towards some of these items.

13:16.080 --> 13:20.680
So hence, the concern on how we really show up

13:20.680 --> 13:23.040
in the first year of reporting.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.680
But Adi Nash, then, are you telling me

13:24.680 --> 13:29.880
that you already have done the data collection, right?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.200
For what you believe should be disclosed

13:32.200 --> 13:34.920
by the end of this week.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.280
You have for the truly guaranteed days.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.120
Yeah.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.280
I mean, what is the question today?

13:46.280 --> 13:48.720
Is it the, are you asking for an exemption

13:48.720 --> 13:50.880
to use the global solution and the global end

13:50.880 --> 13:52.320
to follow the global process?

13:54.520 --> 13:56.000
Now, that's the intent, Matthew.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.760
Just to bring you wherever.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.280
Thank you.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.520
Where that goes from the country

14:01.520 --> 14:03.360
is to go with the manual disclosure,

14:03.360 --> 14:07.880
but for now, standard global transparency solution

14:07.880 --> 14:09.720
because we recently implemented.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.800
I'm absolutely, but for me, it's fine.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.640
Absolutely.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.240
I mean, I will never prevent you

14:15.240 --> 14:17.120
to do what you feel it's best for you.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.280
We are no one to say that.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.880
I mean, I feel it's a little bit ashamed

14:20.880 --> 14:23.360
that the teams and so much effort to implement.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.520
I don't know exactly if we missed something

14:25.520 --> 14:28.960
in the business requirements,

14:28.960 --> 14:31.800
or if we did not enough listen to you.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.000
But obviously, if you have the report really

14:35.000 --> 14:37.960
in with the manual data collection

14:37.960 --> 14:39.960
and you feel comfortable with the figures,

14:39.960 --> 14:42.480
you should report that you have definitely.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.040
I mean, I don't know.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.720
I mean, Ashley, is it what you were asking for more?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.440
That was the, that was the ask,

14:48.440 --> 14:53.960
but you will also develop a couple of other evolving

14:53.960 --> 14:54.800
situations.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.720
The other evolving situation was one

14:56.720 --> 15:01.520
of the key signatories to the transparency report

15:01.520 --> 15:03.520
was the country precedent.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.160
And the country precedent would have

15:06.160 --> 15:08.920
to record a signature on the report

15:08.920 --> 15:11.280
before the report is presented.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.360
And he was also traveling.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.440
So he's currently out of the country.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.600
So before he moved out of the country

15:19.600 --> 15:22.840
or official purpose, we had to kind of see the report.

15:24.440 --> 15:29.080
And be comfortable with what was captured in the report.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.760
So if, and those were the pieces.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.160
And of course, all of this was in accordance

15:34.160 --> 15:40.360
and in line with how the association guided us.

15:40.360 --> 15:44.120
And what was the directive in terms

15:44.120 --> 15:46.200
of how it had to be presented.

15:46.200 --> 15:52.040
So those were, of course, weighed in also very heavily.

15:52.040 --> 15:56.840
And hence the ask and the request from Ashley.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.880
I mean, Ashley, no, no, so let's go apparently,

15:59.880 --> 16:03.160
you're already, you know, you're done with the reporting.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.240
So let's continue what you've initiated.

16:05.240 --> 16:10.040
Just first of all, and I hope, let's be,

16:10.040 --> 16:11.840
let's speak honestly and transparently,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.480
even if the team is on the phone today.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.040
But do you feel that we, we as a global transparency team,

16:17.040 --> 16:19.040
we miss something about your requirements.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.280
And using that, that there was a misduring the project

16:22.280 --> 16:26.160
that we, explaining why we are facing this situation today.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.520
Matthew, I'm really sorry.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.560
I don't have the historical reference

16:30.560 --> 16:33.040
because I got into the role six months back.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.040
Okay.

16:34.040 --> 16:39.040
And, and I'm, I'm just carrying the work

16:39.960 --> 16:42.320
that was already underway.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.760
So I, I'm not really, okay.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.440
I'm sure of what conversations have happened before.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
I'm really sorry.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.480
I'm not able to throw much light on that.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.440
Okay, maybe satish one last question

16:56.440 --> 16:57.640
and then I ended up to you.

16:57.640 --> 17:02.240
So, at the nation and, and how much are they on?

17:02.240 --> 17:04.520
Are you comfortable also?

17:04.520 --> 17:08.000
And can we say that, even if this one is done manually?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.320
First, we would need to, if this is okay with you,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.800
we would need to load the data into the global transparency

17:12.800 --> 17:16.480
solution because for internal analytics purpose,

17:16.480 --> 17:19.360
we need to have a full view of the total transfer of values

17:19.360 --> 17:22.600
for the company because we are presenting, for example,

17:22.600 --> 17:24.400
to Patrick Harper on Monday.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.640
And he wants to see the entire, the, the entire tier of his,

17:28.640 --> 17:33.120
but this one and they're also more importantly,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.440
because this one is just for internal analytics,

17:35.440 --> 17:37.880
but more importantly, are you comfortable that,

17:37.880 --> 17:39.800
for the, I mean, are you okay?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.960
Sorry, that for the future, we will really understand

17:43.760 --> 17:48.760
how we should address the issues and moving for one final solution

17:51.080 --> 17:53.920
for you to get the data directly from the global solution

17:53.920 --> 17:57.200
because colleagues, these should save significant time

17:57.200 --> 17:58.160
on you, right?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.480
And so sorry that you spent so much time

18:00.480 --> 18:02.840
on transparency, but in the future,

18:02.840 --> 18:04.520
we should be able to provide you something

18:04.520 --> 18:07.840
that you are mostly comfortable with and you just review

18:07.840 --> 18:11.200
and sign off if you agree with you.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.880
Okay, absolutely, absolutely Matthew,

18:13.880 --> 18:16.000
and I think that's the whole idea.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.040
And we would definitely going forward

18:20.040 --> 18:23.800
like to rely on the global transparency tool.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.440
And we need to find some solutions to some of these challenges

18:27.440 --> 18:31.880
that we have enough in our, in our systems today

18:31.880 --> 18:35.920
and how do we really overcome that,

18:35.920 --> 18:38.520
but we're really looking up to you

18:38.520 --> 18:41.080
to help us find solutions.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.320
But that's clearly the intent.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.000
I would really want to ask you,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.120
what do we also want to kind of share?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.760
What's our finding of the reporting

18:50.760 --> 18:52.400
and how our format looks like

18:52.400 --> 18:54.520
and what is it that you want to share with them?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.440
In the current UCP, report, how is it?

18:58.440 --> 19:01.160
Do you want to share that data also with them?

19:01.160 --> 19:05.800
Yes, so we have actually have that format ready

19:05.800 --> 19:07.800
with us, the way UCP and P,

19:07.800 --> 19:13.040
asked us to report it with the total amount

19:13.040 --> 19:15.760
and total aggregate level.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.440
So, and we got this data from the backup data

19:20.440 --> 19:25.440
where we have the spent, under different spend here.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.760
So we are having a specific data set

19:31.760 --> 19:35.200
for speaker fees, render fees and also it gives

19:35.200 --> 19:40.200
a complete visibility how that total data is coming for.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.040
So we have the backup data and from there,

19:44.040 --> 19:48.200
we have generated the report.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.640
Okay, so we will load your report

19:50.640 --> 19:53.200
into the global transparency solution, right?

19:54.200 --> 19:56.240
Afterwards, once you've published,

19:56.240 --> 19:57.760
we will take your data excel

19:57.760 --> 20:01.360
and we will load that into the global transparency solution.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.400
So Matthew, do you mean to say

20:04.400 --> 20:08.640
that once this posted entries or posted SAP line items

20:08.640 --> 20:11.680
are reaching in the SAP IBI?

20:11.680 --> 20:12.680
That's when we do it?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.000
I need to discuss with the team

20:18.000 --> 20:19.760
because you're absolutely right, sorry.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.120
We already have access to the data, right?

20:22.120 --> 20:24.000
Because we already have the interface with ACP,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.400
so we don't need to reload your Excel file,

20:26.400 --> 20:28.080
we have the data, okay?

20:28.080 --> 20:30.920
Now forget about what I said and forget about what I said.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.320
No, the only question mark would be on the RCF control

20:35.320 --> 20:39.120
colleagues, so there are like six, so now it's nine,

20:39.120 --> 20:40.400
we increase to nine.

20:40.400 --> 20:45.400
We have nine RCF controls that we need to execute

20:46.440 --> 20:50.640
on the countries in scope of transparency reporting.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.280
And so we need to see how we do that without you

20:54.280 --> 20:56.200
following the global process.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.960
But it's manageable, we do it with the US

20:57.960 --> 21:00.240
and they are not following the global process.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.640
So just that please keep in mind that we need to work together

21:03.640 --> 21:05.000
on the RCF controls.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.360
And it's all about colleagues,

21:08.360 --> 21:12.040
it's all about reconciliation between SAP

21:12.040 --> 21:17.040
and what has been reported, so it's as your face,

21:17.560 --> 21:22.360
I think it's a URR, RCF, are you familiar with RCF?

21:22.360 --> 21:24.920
Yeah, so that's what I'm talking about.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.800
Self-assessment, right?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.320
Sorry, yeah, self-assessment,

21:28.320 --> 21:30.600
I'm key control testing.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.440
Yeah, one that is supposed to be done in July.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.240
Yeah, you're correct.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.200
You're already very familiar with the process.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.560
Yes, correct.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.680
So reset issue, you are waiting for some time.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.160
Sorry, no worries Matthew.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.040
Just to commend on the question that you asked,

21:50.040 --> 21:53.280
did we miss during the initial project scooping?

21:53.280 --> 21:56.480
I have double verified all the URR's documentation

21:56.480 --> 22:00.680
plus the confirmation that we got during the input collection

22:00.680 --> 22:03.280
when we have set in the ITR also.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.320
So this is not a miss,

22:05.320 --> 22:08.680
the information came out to light very recently.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.320
So I can share the information of course.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.880
I definitely did, but I can tell from Matthew.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.280
But Matthew, I think you know,

22:16.280 --> 22:19.160
I don't think we should look at this as a miss

22:19.160 --> 22:22.080
or a lack of support,

22:22.080 --> 22:24.920
but I think being the first year of transparency,

22:24.920 --> 22:27.880
supporting a lot of these aspects

22:27.880 --> 22:31.840
are also learning for us as well, right?

22:31.840 --> 22:36.640
So I think we are also learning as we're going along

22:36.640 --> 22:39.800
and some of these pieces which were never,

22:39.800 --> 22:42.200
I mean, which used to happen the way it is happening,

22:42.200 --> 22:44.640
but we never really saw that.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.360
For example, the posting bit,

22:48.360 --> 22:51.080
it never really probably occurred to us

22:51.080 --> 22:53.320
that this is the way it would be.

22:53.320 --> 22:58.320
So I think it's more of a discovery phase.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.000
Today as we've completed the year,

23:01.000 --> 23:05.280
I think we are a lot more informed of how things have,

23:05.280 --> 23:07.600
what things happen and how they get reported

23:07.600 --> 23:09.720
and what we need to keep in mind.

23:09.720 --> 23:13.360
And I think we just need to kind of really integrate

23:13.360 --> 23:14.920
that into our tool,

23:14.920 --> 23:17.920
but I don't need that as a miss or a lack of support.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.760
I don't see it that way.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.800
I just see that as a first-time unique experience

23:23.800 --> 23:24.640
that we've had.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.160
And so we might not have been able to articulate everything

23:28.160 --> 23:29.600
and we might not have been visible

23:29.600 --> 23:32.680
of every possible thing that there is.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.720
And to that extent,

23:34.720 --> 23:37.160
there could also be a miss from our end,

23:37.160 --> 23:40.280
but I don't see that as a lack of support from any team.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.440
Definitely not.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.680
No, no, no, I'm glad you said,

23:42.680 --> 23:43.480
you're not doing this,

23:43.480 --> 23:45.280
I think we're pointing to us now.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.240
So I'd now appreciate that.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.880
I'm not really good.

23:48.880 --> 23:53.320
And this is true that with the complex regulatory requirements,

23:53.320 --> 23:56.120
this is true that sometimes it takes a bit,

23:56.120 --> 23:59.320
it's not as straightforward as a normal FIA country.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.080
So, yeah, I mean, it is what it is.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.080
But thanks a lot.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.160
So just to kind of share that's okay, Matthew.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.640
So there were some member organizations

24:08.640 --> 24:11.520
which were using GKC tools in their own,

24:11.520 --> 24:15.240
it could be astral or it could be BMS, I don't remember.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.360
And when they came and there were many workshops

24:18.360 --> 24:22.400
that were conducted by the local association,

24:22.400 --> 24:25.120
industry association on this topic, right?

24:25.120 --> 24:30.120
And one that we recently participated in,

24:31.560 --> 24:33.720
I think they were talking about the challenges

24:33.720 --> 24:37.520
of their global GTC tool exactly on these fronts.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.360
Yeah.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.800
Because even their tool was unable to capture

24:41.800 --> 24:45.560
the post-aid or the accrued ADA,

24:45.560 --> 24:48.720
and it's just giving them an aggregated ones.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.520
Because that's the requirement

24:51.520 --> 24:54.960
across the other affiliate countries worldwide.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.800
India is a very different, unique local, global,

24:57.800 --> 25:00.920
global, the requirement of the government

25:00.920 --> 25:02.560
is very, very different.

25:02.560 --> 25:06.720
So then they have resorted also to manual pieces

25:06.720 --> 25:09.000
and to ensure that all the member organization

25:09.000 --> 25:10.720
have a standard approach.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.240
So there was a directive saying

25:12.240 --> 25:13.720
that let's approach it this way.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.040
So it's evolving one method.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.960
So honestly, time may be venting,

25:18.960 --> 25:21.760
looked at the data, we really were trying to rack up brains

25:21.760 --> 25:24.160
and say that, how do we do this?

25:24.160 --> 25:26.920
Can you just, yeah, please.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.280
You here to understand this,

25:29.280 --> 25:32.920
is there any opportunity for India to do a republication

25:34.000 --> 25:38.520
or do we really strict about any republication?

25:38.520 --> 25:40.520
Why would you do a question?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.880
What would a question is a case?

25:41.880 --> 25:45.000
I think even this was the question that some of us asked.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.840
Because the fear of misreporting was so high,

25:48.840 --> 25:52.560
we checked with the DOP if there was a case of,

25:52.560 --> 25:57.560
or if there's a possibility of re-submitting this,

25:58.840 --> 26:01.840
just like your income tax, advance tax, et cetera.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.160
And it's still the question up in the air.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.400
We don't know.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.560
We don't know what DOP,

26:07.560 --> 26:11.920
because DOP is keeping all the cards pretty close to the chest.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.480
And we really don't know what would the directives be

26:16.480 --> 26:20.320
and how, and if they would allow us a review,

26:20.320 --> 26:22.840
because a lot of companies came up with the proposal

26:22.840 --> 26:24.200
that things would be a lot more clear

26:24.200 --> 26:26.440
or post 31st of March.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.080
And after we have submitted,

26:28.080 --> 26:30.080
there could be a lot more clarity that would come in.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.000
So do we have an opportunity to re-submitted?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.560
We have had no response to this.

26:35.560 --> 26:40.560
We'll have to wait and watch and see how things evolve from here.

26:41.520 --> 26:46.120
The reason I wish, the way that we approach the GT solution,

26:46.120 --> 26:48.680
it is same for all the markets, right?

26:48.680 --> 26:51.560
But the only difference that I see between other markets

26:51.560 --> 26:54.600
and India is, the window is only two months.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.760
So for other countries, it is around six months.

26:57.760 --> 27:02.000
So by the time when we do a disclosure for other markets,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.800
all the actuals are already paid.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.400
That means the clear dates already come with us, right?

27:09.400 --> 27:11.640
So that we were able to disclose all the data.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.560
So that's the reason I'm just looking at

27:16.560 --> 27:18.960
if there is any opportunity for re-submitting the report

27:18.960 --> 27:22.600
after a quarter or so, then it would solve by itself.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.800
You know, the two that we have.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.240
I think we have requested as an organization,

27:29.240 --> 27:34.080
as an association for a window again, Sathish,

27:34.080 --> 27:36.360
but there has been no response from the DOP.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.160
But if that happens and if there is a second window available,

27:41.160 --> 27:45.640
going forward, then GTC tool becomes the best option, right?

27:45.640 --> 27:50.640
So, but without any modifications in the current way, right?

27:51.240 --> 27:53.960
Because then everything gets easily visible

27:53.960 --> 27:56.240
and you can just report whatever really comes out of it.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.680
But if it is not, if it is not,

27:58.680 --> 28:01.480
then we might have to really rethink on the design

28:01.480 --> 28:05.800
and see what can be changed

28:05.800 --> 28:10.120
and how can we really capture the posted data.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.080
But that's for a later date, but let's just go ahead.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.120
But this is a window question.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.080
It's still up in the air.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.760
We don't know how it's going to manifest,

28:19.760 --> 28:21.640
but just give us some time.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.000
We will definitely keep you informed

28:24.000 --> 28:26.880
of what and how this is evolving.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.320
But at the stage, I'm as clueless as you are.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.120
Honestly, I don't have any answer.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
Thank you.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.360
And Chris, we'll need to do a make a reconciliation

28:35.360 --> 28:39.880
between SAP and Bishur, with definitively.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.680
And once there will be this reconciliation option

28:43.680 --> 28:45.960
in Bishur, maybe, I mean, we have already

28:45.960 --> 28:48.520
the reconciliation option in Bishur with SAP to be.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.520
We have two media.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.640
These terms are not actually linked, Matthew.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.760
Be sure this app, they don't speak to each other.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.960
But it's my understanding is that it's

28:59.960 --> 29:03.000
planned for various in the next three days or two, right?

29:03.000 --> 29:06.600
It should be available very soon.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.120
Probably as a country, we don't have that information, Matthew.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.320
OK, the second I will check with the person

29:11.320 --> 29:13.240
with the system owner in the browser.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.200
I will check that too.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.200
I will let you know.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.680
Because then, then, also, soft truths

29:17.680 --> 29:21.480
will be more be sure than SAP then.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.000
For you.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.160
Call the particulates.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.520
So Matthew, we also have another third system, which

29:26.520 --> 29:28.960
is conquer, because there are times

29:28.960 --> 29:34.000
when we also book the flights, et cetera,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.800
accommodation through conquer.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.800
Yeah.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.800
OK.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
Easy.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.800
Easy.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
PCD.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.760
It is not integrated.

29:44.760 --> 29:49.200
The PCD is integrated with GTC.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.000
It's a global transparency solution.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
Yeah.

29:53.800 --> 29:54.560
OK.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.800
I mean, look, this is a discussion we

29:56.800 --> 29:57.680
can continue.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.080
We are already over time.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.720
But definitely, let's conclude.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.840
Please, thanks, colleagues, so much for your manual,

30:03.840 --> 30:07.920
for having prepared the disclosure manually.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.080
Big, big, big thank you for that.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.680
Effectively, it's a distance for us as well.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.960
And let's meet after your disclosure in order

30:14.960 --> 30:17.720
to make sure that we adjust our process

30:17.720 --> 30:19.800
in order to make your requirements.

30:19.800 --> 30:24.640
But, colleagues, we are covering 50 plus countries.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.200
So I'm very sure that even if you have specific requirements,

30:28.200 --> 30:29.080
we will manage.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.440
We should manage.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.280
We will be able to achieve that.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.120
No, thank you, Matthew.

30:33.120 --> 30:37.520
In fact, we definitely want to rely on GTC

30:37.520 --> 30:41.240
for the upcoming reporting the next year.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.880
And we will come back to you with what

30:43.880 --> 30:47.200
is the status with the DOP this year.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.680
We'll share with you everything that we have.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.200
And we'll walk together and see what we can do.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.040
Fantastic.

30:53.040 --> 30:53.800
Fantastic.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.480
Hey, Avina, sure.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.680
So I know the expectations are there

30:56.680 --> 30:59.760
from the local association, just to be realistic also

30:59.760 --> 31:02.160
from what we observed from the other countries

31:02.160 --> 31:04.640
with the first year of disclosure.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.800
Honestly, you need exactly, as you say before,

31:07.800 --> 31:10.000
the companies then in a few years

31:10.000 --> 31:13.240
to be at the level that is expected from the association.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.880
So I wouldn't worry too much to be honest with you.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.280
Absolutely.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.840
It's just that there have been a few instances

31:19.840 --> 31:24.600
where the government is being a little hard

31:24.600 --> 31:26.880
on a couple of organizations.

31:26.880 --> 31:30.000
So we just don't want to be on the wrong side.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.680
And it's just that all the presidents

31:33.680 --> 31:38.480
are just being doubly careful, more cautious than brave.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.600
So I think we'll get there.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.680
So hopefully the ticket can lead to fines.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.360
It's more than fines.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.280
They won't be prosecuted.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.440
Is it a loo or is it a good?

31:50.440 --> 31:50.960
It's a loo.

31:50.960 --> 31:51.800
So what?

31:51.800 --> 31:55.640
So I think in the first year, given one

31:55.640 --> 31:59.400
of the member organizations, the government

31:59.400 --> 32:04.080
has come so hard that it's not just so a lot of agencies

32:04.080 --> 32:07.640
can really come after you, the income tax.

32:07.640 --> 32:11.440
And all of the investigative agencies

32:11.440 --> 32:14.040
can really open, can come knocking on the doors.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.400
This is this.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.840
And that's the worry.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.520
And all your books of account are going to be opened up.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.560
So I don't know how this will mature.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.240
And given the first year, at this point of time,

32:26.240 --> 32:27.800
it's only conjecture.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.800
But I think if we will have to just wait and watch

32:30.800 --> 32:32.880
what's the maturity with which government really

32:32.880 --> 32:35.920
looks at this and how it handles this.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.160
But at this point of time, it really

32:37.160 --> 32:38.560
looks very draconian.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.320
And it's more fear.

32:41.320 --> 32:45.760
And hence, people are a little cautious

32:45.760 --> 32:48.640
and don't want to be on the wrong side.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.920
So that's the whole idea, Matthew.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.920
OK.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.440
Look, we are here.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.720
So it's not because you agree that you will do it manually.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.640
If you need any help, we are a big team.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.000
40 plus people.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.160
We are here to support you.

33:04.160 --> 33:08.080
So should you need our help to reduce something,

33:08.080 --> 33:10.160
to load data for you or whatever it is,

33:10.160 --> 33:12.720
just let us know.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.440
Really big help, Matthew.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.680
Thanks a ton to you and your team for the help and support.

33:17.680 --> 33:19.720
And Rashi has been of great help.

33:19.720 --> 33:20.880
And I don't see it again.

33:20.880 --> 33:21.720
I want to re-emphasize.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.240
I don't think it's a lack of support.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.720
In fact, we've had a lot of support.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.800
And I can go and record to say this.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.240
And at least the last six months, I've

33:30.240 --> 33:32.040
missed a lot of support.

33:32.040 --> 33:35.320
And I think it's because it's an evolving and a dynamic one,

33:35.320 --> 33:39.320
it's possible that we've also missed a couple of things.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.960
But just give us this one cycle.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.000
And we'll see how it goes from year on.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.800
Sounds big.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.480
Sounds big.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.320
And thanks for saying that about the team.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.880
I had not done that up to 30.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.400
But thanks for saying.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.920
Thank you so much.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.680
Take care.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.200
We stay here.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.200
Thanks a lot.

33:54.200 --> 33:54.720
Thank you.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.720
Thank you.

33:55.720 --> 33:56.560
Thank you.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.200
Take care, everyone.

33:58.200 --> 33:58.960
Hey, thanks.
