00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.840
Tim and Melinda are running late.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.040
But we have a lot to get through.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.960
So we should get started.

00:19.960 --> 00:25.040
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

00:25.040 --> 00:29.000
Yes, of course, Tony.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.760
No problem.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.640
Thanks.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.840
OK, let's get the ball rolling.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.520
First on the agenda today.

00:41.520 --> 00:47.720
Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy

00:47.720 --> 00:51.080
for our new beverage, ginger cola?

00:51.080 --> 00:53.320
Yes, Tony.

00:53.320 --> 00:59.040
Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola

00:59.040 --> 01:02.600
as a health and energy drink.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.960
Fantastic.

01:04.960 --> 01:09.240
I think this will be our next big hit.

01:09.240 --> 01:14.040
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.680
It tastes great.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.040
It's healthy.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.720
And it has very low calories.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.280
It's perfect for working out.

01:26.280 --> 01:31.240
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.960
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

01:36.960 --> 01:41.280
We still have a few things to work out.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.040
But we are planning to have a power hitter

01:45.040 --> 01:50.160
from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

01:50.200 --> 01:54.120
We still have to iron out some details.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.880
But we think he's a great fit.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.400
Great idea.

02:00.400 --> 02:05.480
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting

02:05.480 --> 02:10.360
for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.

02:10.360 --> 02:14.040
Of course, that's really important.

02:14.040 --> 02:18.760
But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

02:18.760 --> 02:25.560
OK, Tony, I will be ready to present to everyone then.

02:25.560 --> 02:29.280
Let's move on to the next topic.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.560
I have sent around an action list for each of you

02:32.560 --> 02:35.240
to take a look at.

02:35.240 --> 02:40.080
It includes a look at the following calls to action

02:40.080 --> 02:44.360
that we need to address for the upcoming charity

02:44.360 --> 02:46.880
Walkathon.

02:46.880 --> 02:53.240
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.080
This is extremely important for us.

02:57.080 --> 03:01.040
We need to give back to the community.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.360
I couldn't agree more.

03:04.360 --> 03:08.920
This has been at the top of all our agendas.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.960
And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.480
Let me start things off.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.680
If that's OK with everyone else.
