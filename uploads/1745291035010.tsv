0	10000	Hello everyone.
10000	13800	Tim and Melinda are running late.
13800	17000	But we have a lot to get through.
17000	20040	So we should get started.
20040	25240	Jason, can you please take the minutes today?
25240	29000	Yes, of course, Tony.
29000	31000	No problem.
31000	33000	Thanks.
33000	38000	Okay, let's get the ball rolling.
38000	41000	First on the agenda today,
41000	45000	Carrie, can you please give us an update
45000	51000	on the marketing strategy for our new beverage ginger cola?
51000	53000	Yes, Tony.
53000	58000	Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola
58000	62000	as a health and energy drink.
62000	64000	Fantastic.
64000	69000	I think this will be our next big hit.
69000	73000	There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.
73000	76000	It tastes great.
76000	78000	It's healthy.
78000	82000	And it has very low calories.
82000	86000	It's perfect for working out.
86000	91000	Let's make this the next red bull energy drink.
91000	96000	Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?
96000	101000	We still have a few things to work out.
101000	105000	But we are planning to have a power hitter
105000	110000	from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.
110000	114000	We still have to iron out some details.
114000	118000	But we think he's a great fit.
118000	120000	Great idea.
120000	125000	Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting.
125000	130000	For a more in-depth look at what you have planned.
130000	134000	Of course, that's really important.
134000	138000	But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.
138000	141000	Okay, Tony.
141000	145000	I will be ready to present to everyone then.
145000	149000	Let's move on to the next topic.
149000	155000	I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.
155000	160000	It includes a look at the following calls to action
160000	166000	that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.
167000	173000	Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.
173000	177000	This is extremely important for us.
177000	181000	We need to give back to the community.
181000	184000	I couldn't agree more.
184000	189000	This has been at the top of all our agendas.
189000	194000	And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.
194000	196000	Let me start things off.
196000	201000	If that's okay with everyone else.
