0	8000	So we just have two months to ensure all the payments are cleared and ensure we get into the report.
8000	14000	So have you experienced any situation like this where some of the payments which are not cleared?
14000	23000	In that case the event still falls in the year within the year but the payment happens after the financial year.
24000	32000	So how are the pharmaceutical companies reporting? Do we have a window again to update the report?
34000	46000	So generally for the other country reports we have a more broad let's say timeline.
47000	55000	I can ask you to the authority in India if they have any suggestion.
55000	61000	I'm not sure if we have seen something similar in the past but I will check also internally.
64000	72000	So basically the thing is that even if you have done the activities in the year sometimes the payment came.
73000	81000	I mean come after the two months where you are expected to collect all the expenses.
81000	90000	Right now we can look at the approved amounts in wise amounts before even making the payment.
90000	97000	So I'm consolidated all of it for the services that we have utilized and make the report.
98000	106000	Now what happens is but when we automate the systems the payment comes into the next period.
106000	110000	But the payment still shows in the previous period.
110000	119000	So there will be a conflict in terms of the consolidation and reporting and this is going to be there forever.
120000	128000	So any kind of suggestions or guidance over this will there be any secondary window that will be opened up.
128000	137000	If I have dated payments you know ideally it should be so that you know all that we are trying to do is generally get the data.
137000	140000	You know voluntary report.
141000	154000	So another but another thing that we can ask to the authority is that if it's possible to make amendments to what was disclosed.
154000	166000	Just because of this situation so from from a legal perspective I think I can check with the authority and we can find a solution.
167000	175000	From a system perspective I don't think there's anything to change at the moment for Audi.
175000	183000	We don't have to add but what I personally feel is for no what is we have two company courts.
183000	192000	So right now I think we have we have provision only one report for India but more you know I think we have to generate two reports
193000	201000	because we have one what is okay limited and no what is in the unlimited and we have got payments.
201000	205000	So we have to segregate that.
205000	218000	Okay I think yeah on that we can we can definitely divide into two different entities but I see that there's Sara.
219000	222000	Everyone apology for being late.
222000	229000	No but I mean I was like I was informed that she was late and I wouldn't have started if not.
229000	246000	So Sara basically the the figure that we we would need to check with the with the local authority is what happened if the payment is done after the so basically the reports.
246000	260000	The reporting period ends in December but then the reporting is done after two months but some payments are not yet done after two months from the closing of the year.
261000	278000	So we have these payments that are outside both reporting period basically because they are not fully collected in the correct year but neither on the second year because the activities is from the previous year.
278000	306000	So basically what we need to check is if they can correct or amend the reporting done or if there's any best practice to follow like doing it the next year or reporting in a different way the expenses that are not yet paid before the deadline.
306000	312000	I don't know if you have any any other suggestion on that or ideas.
312000	325000	No we can we can double check what what should be the approach to be followed for what regards IITR you know guys we have it as a standard.
326000	341000	The possibility to run delta reports and so to include only the leftovers maybe lay payments that were uploaded in the system later compared with the deadlines and whatsoever.
341000	354000	So you could run a delta maybe or you could even decide to generate a second version of the report and entire second version of the report including also the leftovers that were loaded in a later stage.
355000	370000	I think as long as the regulatory allows any of these options you know it would be a good solution altogether and I believe you know not just no artist all the farmers and farmer companies will have the same issue technically.
370000	383000	So maybe some kind of a guidance over there and then we can see if it has to be a updated report with consolidation or the leftover part.
383000	388000	Okay. We will we will investigate it.
388000	392000	This is not very urgent.
392000	402000	But the sooner it is better because again we missed the second semester of this year then we will end up in the same situation for the next year.
402000	410000	Right now we have decided to provision all the you know pending payments also into the report manually.
410000	422000	Unfortunately we cannot use the IITR report for this disclosure but we will try to make some corrections and kind of keep the systems up and running.
422000	427000	Okay. Do you have any of the question?
427000	432000	Shasateesh came because of some late payments that came in.
432000	435000	Late payments that are not done it.
435000	436000	Okay.
436000	449000	So not meaning it so that means we have to provision it because you know the country team is very particular about ensuring everything anything the services are received.
449000	451000	They want to show the amounts.
451000	459000	They do not want to say because the penalty is and the consequences could be higher because there is no proper guidance over it.
459000	466000	Once we have the guidance then I think we can relax this you know constantly.
466000	469000	Yeah there might be also some follow ups by the government.
469000	481000	I'm assuming considering that it is the first year reporting and I think they will start receiving some questions as such maybe they hopefully they will release on frequently asked questions.
481000	493000	And what we also heard is the country ERC head has already been in touch with the authorities and there were questions around it but there is no proper response.
493000	498000	Maybe that's where I thought you know I will seek your help to see if your contacts can help.
498000	506000	Maybe there is a guideline or something that they are trying to establish because these questions are pretty normal you know.
506000	510000	Yes of course.
510000	514000	Okay let's decide.
514000	516000	Sorry sorry.
516000	518000	No no no.
518000	529000	So conclude from if we if we take the info specifications that is currently the specs are to disclose the report based on the activity dates.
529000	540000	So even if a payment is loaded in 2026 for example when you are you have to disclose it as part of an activity of 2025.
540000	541000	Yes.
541000	546000	The debt that you will work in any way any day it's also the read the complete read down should work.
546000	554000	But again let's let's try to get an understanding of what should be on the approach to the authorities.
554000	566000	Because for us it will be considered as a republication if we are updating that we need to get a sign off in the first place from the transparency change board.
566000	574000	And if the country provisions that you know maybe after three months or four months another update to the report it will be much easier.
574000	578000	We don't have to change anything.
578000	592000	Okay then I think so basically it's not the payment is a so the problem is not when the payment happened but when you are the expense.
592000	594000	Correct.
594000	604000	Okay so basically when it is cleared is when we will hit the systems the information will hit the system then we will be able to consolidate it.
604000	615000	Because you have an automation that clear the expense when it is paid right correct.
615000	620000	Okay now I understand.
620000	626000	Okay let's try to get in touch with the authority.
626000	634000	Okay and any any 22 timeline then this could be shared across.
634000	644000	So we will reach out also today I mean tomorrow at the latest but the problem is when the answer and we cannot provide a time limit.
644000	650000	Okay then let us settle that during our next monthly correct and see if we have an answer.
650000	662000	If we don't receive any answer before we can we can share let's say a second request during our next call.
662000	664000	Okay sounds good.
664000	679000	Yes I think just to keep everybody honest here we reached out already I think a couple of three months ago to address a question that came in but we did not receive any answer back then.
679000	690000	So just to set the expectation not not sure if we will be able to get a reply when we will try to follow up more and more that for sure.
690000	702000	But yeah we didn't get much much response so far actually no responses so far so I can understand.
703000	710000	Okay let's hope for the best we get some response and some window you know when we get home now.
710000	712000	Okay thank you very much.
712000	714000	Okay thank you so much.
714000	716000	Thank you thank you.
716000	718000	Thank you bye.
