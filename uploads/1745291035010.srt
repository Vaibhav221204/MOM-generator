00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Tim and Melinda are running late.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,000
But we have a lot to get through.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,040
So we should get started.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,240
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, of course, Tony.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No problem.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thanks.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, let's get the ball rolling.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
First on the agenda today,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Carrie, can you please give us an update

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
on the marketing strategy for our new beverage ginger cola?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, Tony.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
as a health and energy drink.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Fantastic.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I think this will be our next big hit.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It tastes great.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's healthy.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And it has very low calories.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's perfect for working out.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's make this the next red bull energy drink.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We still have a few things to work out.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we are planning to have a power hitter

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We still have to iron out some details.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But we think he's a great fit.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Great idea.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For a more in-depth look at what you have planned.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Of course, that's really important.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, Tony.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will be ready to present to everyone then.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's move on to the next topic.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It includes a look at the following calls to action

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is extremely important for us.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We need to give back to the community.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I couldn't agree more.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This has been at the top of all our agendas.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let me start things off.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If that's okay with everyone else.
