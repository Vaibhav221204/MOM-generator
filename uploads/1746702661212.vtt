00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.960
Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get

00:17.960 --> 00:19.960
started.

00:19.960 --> 00:25.920
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

00:25.920 --> 00:29.000
Yes, of course, Tony.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
No problem.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Thanks.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Okay.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's get the ball rolling.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
First on the agenda today.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy for our new beverage,

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Ginger Cola?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes, Tony.

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, we have decided to pitch the new Ginger Cola as a health and energy drink.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Fantastic.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I think this will be our next big hit.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It tastes great.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It's healthy.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And it has very low calories.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
It's perfect for working out.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
We still have to iron out some details, but we think he's a great fit.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Great idea.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
Of course, that's really important, but we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Okay, Tony.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I will be ready to present to everyone then.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Let's move on to the next topic.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.

02:35.000 --> 02:46.000
It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
This is extremely important for us.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
We need to give back to the community.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I couldn't agree more.

03:04.000 --> 03:14.000
This has been at the top of all our agendas, and we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Let me start things off.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
If that's okay with everyone else.
