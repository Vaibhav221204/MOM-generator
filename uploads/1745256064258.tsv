0	10000	Hello, everyone.
10000	13840	Tim and Melinda are running late.
13840	17040	But we have a lot to get through.
17040	20120	So we should get started.
20120	25120	Jason, can you please take the minutes today?
25120	29000	Yes, of course, Tony.
29000	31760	No problem.
31760	33640	Thanks.
33640	37840	OK, let's get the ball rolling.
37840	41520	First on the agenda today.
41520	47720	Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy
47720	51080	for our new beverage, ginger cola?
51080	53320	Yes, Tony.
53320	59040	Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola
59040	62600	as a health and energy drink.
62600	64960	Fantastic.
64960	69240	I think this will be our next big hit.
69240	74040	There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.
74040	76680	It tastes great.
76680	79040	It's healthy.
79040	82720	And it has very low calories.
82720	86280	It's perfect for working out.
86280	91240	Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.
91240	96960	Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?
96960	101280	We still have a few things to work out.
101280	105040	But we are planning to have a power hitter
105040	110160	from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.
110200	114120	We still have to iron out some details.
114120	117880	But we think he's a great fit.
117880	120400	Great idea.
120400	125480	Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting
125480	130360	for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.
130360	134040	Of course, that's really important.
134040	138760	But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.
138760	145560	OK, Tony, I will be ready to present to everyone then.
145560	149280	Let's move on to the next topic.
149280	152560	I have sent around an action list for each of you
152560	155240	to take a look at.
155240	160080	It includes a look at the following calls to action
160080	164360	that we need to address for the upcoming charity
164360	166880	Walkathon.
166880	173240	Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.
173240	177080	This is extremely important for us.
177080	181040	We need to give back to the community.
181040	184360	I couldn't agree more.
184360	188920	This has been at the top of all our agendas.
188920	193960	And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.
193960	196480	Let me start things off.
196480	198680	If that's OK with everyone else.
