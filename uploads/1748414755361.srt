1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
fancy process and the global transparency reporting.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,320
We do it at entity, at legal entity level.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,320
To why during the project, we wanted to have one combined report

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,080
for two legal entities.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,000
What was the rationale behind would you

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,800
know that Felix, do you know Rashid?

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
So for India, we have two company codes.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Ion01 and Ion10.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,320
So now we have been tracking all the payment information,

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,640
even when India was an internal market.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,000
We have been using both the company codes

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,240
and tracking the details in GTC for both of these company

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,960
codes.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,360
We were not sure that these two are two separate legal entities,

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,240
so to say.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,920
So this was observed very recently, Matthew,

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,560
when we were going to prepare the idea report,

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,280
that is very important.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,880
I understand that the details.

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,760
So Rashid, if I understand what you're saying

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,720
is that there was not a conscious decision

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,800
from the global transparency team to merge two legal entities

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,600
to one, it's just that we didn't know, right?

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
OK.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Now, the thing is that then the system has

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,160
been set up only for, has been linked to only one legal entity,

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,280
not the two of them.

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Is that correct, Rashid?

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,320
We are uploading data for both.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,960
There is no segregation, but we are uploading data

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,800
for both of these.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,680
But for ITR, you would need then two ITR entries

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
for the two legal entities.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,200
Yes.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Right now, we have a combined report for both

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,000
where there is no segregation basis the legal entity.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
OK.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
And do we know what the local codes say in India?

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,200
Do they say one reporting per legal entity?

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,920
Is it legal requirements?

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
I mean, at least a regular requirement.

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
It is with you.

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,520
It needs to.

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,840
Yeah, it is.

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,680
Because the other entity, which is the Novartis India

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,040
Limited, is the listed entity.

47
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,680
It's listed on the stock exchange.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
And that needs to be disclosed separately.

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
OK.

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,480
And I think then the answer is pretty simple, right?

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,120
So what is the deadline for the reporting?

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,480
I understand it's in a week time.

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,360
It's end of May.

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
This weekend, I would say, target.

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
OK.

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,800
So there is no chance that with IQVA, we can set up the ITR

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
for the missing legal entities.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Is it a statistic?

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I don't think so, Matthew.

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,520
But what we can do is one option is we can generate

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,320
at least one report with the maximum major values

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,440
and invalidate some of the spends for other legal entities.

63
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,360
OK.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
Yes, definitely.

65
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,920
It's one possibility that we do Novartis LSCAR LTT

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
with ITR.

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,240
The only risk that we have is the duplicating,

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,200
the duplicate reporting, because there might be

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,240
how will you split the TEOVs per legal entity?

70
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,880
You see what I mean?

71
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,440
Satish is that there is a risk that we report some of the TEOVs

72
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,640
that are linked to Novartis India LTT,

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,120
meaning that when they will do the manual reporting

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,760
in Excel or whatever, there might be some duplicating TEOVs there.

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
No, we have that segregation at SAP level,

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,960
because we are using that data.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,400
We have that segregation at the end.

78
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,360
So this is my understanding, Matthew.

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
We can generate one report.

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,520
So we can look at the maximum line items and maximum volume.

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,440
And if the volume with Novartis India limited is less,

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,760
then we can invalidate them and still generate a ITR report.

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
OK, so we can manually do that.

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,280
So for that expense, it's just one less question

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,200
before we take a decision.

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,560
So for that expense is clear, and I understand

87
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,360
there is no risk of duplication for indirect spend colleagues.

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
How do we make the split between the TEOVs?

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,960
For us, the source of data is only SAP Matthew.

90
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,840
There is no other indirect also.

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,680
We are taking it from SAP only.

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Then we are good.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,760
So I need this.

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,640
I would effectively be in favor to use the global transparency

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
solution for the reporting of one of the TEOVs,

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,840
but I really want the local compliance team

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,160
to be comfortable with that.

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Perfect.

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,480
So Matthew, really the challenge is here on the second point.

100
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
Product is pretty quickly.

101
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,640
We already discussed earlier with Rashi.

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,080
And there was a work around that they proposed right now,

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
which we could have worked.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
But challenge really is the second point

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,040
where we would have to capture the posting data as well,

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,640
which is not there currently in the SAP I bear report.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,800
So that means we will have a missing data coming in the ITR report.

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
OK.

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,280
Just on this front, I don't.

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
So this is very different.

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,320
Usually transparency reporting is based on payment.

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,360
So we are disclosing what Novartis effectively

113
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,960
give to HTTP's, HEO's, and patient organizations.

114
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,200
What I'm trying to understand is, is it

115
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,160
are we sure that this is the regulatory requirement

116
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,240
to disclose at an event level and not at payment level,

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,680
because this is very new to me.

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
We don't have such situation in any of the 50

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,160
pressed countries that we are managing.

120
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,400
So Matthew, you're absolutely correct.

121
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,200
So Novartis, so not Novartis, India

122
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,280
has got a pretty unique regulatory requirement,

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,680
which requires the pharmaceutical organizations

124
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,600
to report at the event level, which

125
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,200
means once an event happens and the provisions are made,

126
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,760
so the postings that happens through the financial reporting

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,440
needs to be captured.

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,800
And this clarification has been

129
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,960
grow, has been received through the industry association,

130
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,800
and also through the Department of Pharmaceuticals

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,920
for India.

132
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,480
So this is a directive that we've,

133
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,480
so what happens is for March 31st is the annual year end.

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,520
So events that happen the last week or in the month,

135
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,040
depending on the contact of the vendors,

136
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,640
the payment will not get processed in time,

137
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,520
but it will get provisioned.

138
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,040
And if it gets provisioned, it can still be posted.

139
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah.

140
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,080
Payment can happen at a later stage.

141
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,880
So that needs to be, and because the event

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,240
has happened within the fiscal year,

143
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,160
it needs to be captured in the report.

144
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Nice images.

145
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,960
OK.

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,200
But so, and we have a clear view on what

147
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,680
has been accrued as of March 31st, that the net needs,

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,600
sorry, that they need to be reported.

149
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
Do we have a clear visibility on the accords?

150
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Absolutely.

151
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,560
There was absolutely, yes.

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,960
So Matthew, we know that there are payments that are posted,

153
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,000
which have to be considered for the purpose of reporting.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,080
But if you are asking clear visibility,

155
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,200
I think we don't have that split between what is the exact payment

156
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,400
that needs to be, that is in the posting case state,

157
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,000
because that keeps on changing a week after week.

158
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,840
Can you repeat this last sentence?

159
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll teach you the issue of the issue of the issue of the accords.

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,680
So let's assume you have an event of 100.

161
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,440
60 has been already invoiced as of March 1st,

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,680
so it's in an L has been paid, sorry, as in paid.

163
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
So it's already in ACP.

164
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,400
You have 40.

165
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,760
You know that the service has been executed,

166
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,600
so you have 40 that has been accrued.

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,560
But by March 31st, this has not been paid.

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,240
But those 40, if I understand well the whole that we have in India,

169
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,880
those 40 needs to be reflected.

170
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,640
But with the accords that have been done,

171
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,520
we should be able to link the accrued amount with the event.

172
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,200
No?

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,320
So Matthew, we don't have this event while identification.

174
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,200
There is a payment that does not happen yet.

175
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,680
So we don't have even spy event,

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,560
the split between paid and accrued.

177
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,880
But then colleagues, I mean, please don't get us wrong.

178
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,840
We will never force you to use a system

179
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,360
that you are not comfortable to use.

180
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,480
Honestly, considering the situation

181
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,320
and considering that we need to report by the end of the week,

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,240
this is really, we need to go with what we use,

183
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,000
what we feel is the best solution.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
The thing is, if you don't have it for the global transparency solution,

185
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,280
you will not have it neither for in Excel, right?

186
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,920
So how do you plan to solve this?

187
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,280
You see what I mean?

188
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,160
You see what I mean?

189
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,200
If you don't have an ACP and you don't have the accrual pair events,

190
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
even if you are not using the global transparency solution

191
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,240
and you do the reporting manually, how will you do that?

192
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
OK, so the payment which has been happened in SAP

193
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,640
that we can find out from SAP IBI.

194
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Now, the issue right now, what we are having

195
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,480
that those events which happened in February, March,

196
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,840
their invoice have been posted in SAP,

197
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,600
but that does not been paid because payment

198
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,920
would happen basis the credit arms of the vendors.

199
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,760
So it received not invoiced?

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,640
Yes.

201
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,640
So if we can see, we may see our status in SAP

202
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,520
as a post date or created or index, but not the paid.

203
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,120
And that paid goes to SAP IBI.

204
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,840
So those payments basis the SAP individual data.

205
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
We have taken an account and factored for reporting,

206
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,840
but those data is completely missed in this SAP IBI, IBI report.

207
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,120
Probably in future, one, two months, probably two months

208
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,960
down the line, we may get the data.

209
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,040
So that is the reason, the manual data captured,

210
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:02,880
all which are paid plus provision plus a post date.

211
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm happy just to simplify.

212
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,480
In Be sure, we always capture the quotation

213
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,120
as well as invoices.

214
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,640
The basis there, the tracking was already prepared

215
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,680
by the third party, which captures against which event,

216
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,120
which are the payments pending to be posted

217
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,520
and which are already in the SAP.

218
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
So we have that available, but it is just

219
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,000
that we don't have a report which clearly

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,480
by for case, what is paid and posted in SAP right now.

221
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,720
So it was a manual of what that has enabled us to reconcile

222
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
all of this.

223
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,240
Mathya.

224
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,560
Yeah, Mathya.

226
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah.

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,000
And there were two other three, I mean,

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,120
incidentals, but important.

229
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,160
One, this is the first time, of course, India

230
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,560
is coming under the Transparency Reporting Act,

231
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,840
and which means, and also given whatever indications

232
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,640
that we have, the multinational organizations

233
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,840
are going to be under a lot more scrutiny

234
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,880
than the local organizations are.

235
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,280
They've already made an example of one

236
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,040
of the multinational organizations a few months back

237
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,280
on one of the breaches.

238
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,280
And all indications are that all multinational organizations

239
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,200
are going to be under heavy scrutiny

240
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,640
for at least the cycle, right?

241
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,040
So hence, there has been a lot of reliance on what

242
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,160
is going to be a uniform standard approach to reporting

243
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,120
across the members, the member organizations

244
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,280
of the association.

245
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,840
And we are having a uniform approach

246
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,240
towards reporting some of these, right?

247
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,800
So we are being a lot more conservative and not aggressive.

248
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,440
And we are ensuring that even the ones

249
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,200
which have been accrued, and one spare services have been

250
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
taken, but payments will be made at a later stage.

251
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,720
They'll still be reported.

252
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,520
There is a provision where we have,

253
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,840
used disclaimers.

254
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,280
And we have also put in those comments,

255
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,800
but not exhaustive, limited comments,

256
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,080
just to ensure that some of the clarity could be

257
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
provided towards some of these items.

258
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,680
So hence, the concern on how we really show up

259
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,040
in the first year of reporting.

260
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
But Adi Nash, then, are you telling me

261
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,880
that you already have done the data collection, right?

262
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,200
For what you believe should be disclosed

263
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,920
by the end of this week.

264
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,280
You have for the truly guaranteed days.

265
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,120
Yeah.

266
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,280
I mean, what is the question today?

267
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,720
Is it the, are you asking for an exemption

268
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
to use the global solution and the global end

269
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,320
to follow the global process?

270
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,000
Now, that's the intent, Matthew.

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,760
Just to bring you wherever.

272
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,280
Thank you.

273
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,520
Where that goes from the country

274
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,360
is to go with the manual disclosure,

275
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,880
but for now, standard global transparency solution

276
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,720
because we recently implemented.

277
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm absolutely, but for me, it's fine.

278
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,640
Absolutely.

279
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,240
I mean, I will never prevent you

280
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,120
to do what you feel it's best for you.

281
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,280
We are no one to say that.

282
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,880
I mean, I feel it's a little bit ashamed

283
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,360
that the teams and so much effort to implement.

284
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,520
I don't know exactly if we missed something

285
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,960
in the business requirements,

286
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,800
or if we did not enough listen to you.

287
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,000
But obviously, if you have the report really

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,960
in with the manual data collection

289
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
and you feel comfortable with the figures,

290
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,480
you should report that you have definitely.

291
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,040
I mean, I don't know.

292
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,720
I mean, Ashley, is it what you were asking for more?

293
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,440
That was the, that was the ask,

294
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,960
but you will also develop a couple of other evolving

295
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,800
situations.

296
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
The other evolving situation was one

297
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,520
of the key signatories to the transparency report

298
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
was the country precedent.

299
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,160
And the country precedent would have

300
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,920
to record a signature on the report

301
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,280
before the report is presented.

302
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,360
And he was also traveling.

303
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,440
So he's currently out of the country.

304
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,600
So before he moved out of the country

305
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,840
or official purpose, we had to kind of see the report.

306
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,080
And be comfortable with what was captured in the report.

307
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,760
So if, and those were the pieces.

308
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,160
And of course, all of this was in accordance

309
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,360
and in line with how the association guided us.

310
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,120
And what was the directive in terms

311
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,200
of how it had to be presented.

312
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,040
So those were, of course, weighed in also very heavily.

313
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,840
And hence the ask and the request from Ashley.

314
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,880
I mean, Ashley, no, no, so let's go apparently,

315
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,160
you're already, you know, you're done with the reporting.

316
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,240
So let's continue what you've initiated.

317
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,040
Just first of all, and I hope, let's be,

318
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,840
let's speak honestly and transparently,

319
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,480
even if the team is on the phone today.

320
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,040
But do you feel that we, we as a global transparency team,

321
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
we miss something about your requirements.

322
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,280
And using that, that there was a misduring the project

323
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,160
that we, explaining why we are facing this situation today.

324
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,520
Matthew, I'm really sorry.

325
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,560
I don't have the historical reference

326
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
because I got into the role six months back.

327
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Okay.

328
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,040
And, and I'm, I'm just carrying the work

329
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,320
that was already underway.

330
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,760
So I, I'm not really, okay.

331
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,440
I'm sure of what conversations have happened before.

332
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
I'm really sorry.

333
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
I'm not able to throw much light on that.

334
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,440
Okay, maybe satish one last question

335
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,640
and then I ended up to you.

336
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,240
So, at the nation and, and how much are they on?

337
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,520
Are you comfortable also?

338
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,000
And can we say that, even if this one is done manually?

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,320
First, we would need to, if this is okay with you,

340
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,800
we would need to load the data into the global transparency

341
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,480
solution because for internal analytics purpose,

342
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,360
we need to have a full view of the total transfer of values

343
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,600
for the company because we are presenting, for example,

344
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,400
to Patrick Harper on Monday.

345
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,640
And he wants to see the entire, the, the entire tier of his,

346
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,120
but this one and they're also more importantly,

347
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
because this one is just for internal analytics,

348
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,880
but more importantly, are you comfortable that,

349
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,800
for the, I mean, are you okay?

350
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,960
Sorry, that for the future, we will really understand

351
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,760
how we should address the issues and moving for one final solution

352
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,920
for you to get the data directly from the global solution

353
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,200
because colleagues, these should save significant time

354
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,160
on you, right?

355
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
And so sorry that you spent so much time

356
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,840
on transparency, but in the future,

357
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,520
we should be able to provide you something

358
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,840
that you are mostly comfortable with and you just review

359
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,200
and sign off if you agree with you.

360
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,880
Okay, absolutely, absolutely Matthew,

361
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,000
and I think that's the whole idea.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,040
And we would definitely going forward

363
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,800
like to rely on the global transparency tool.

364
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,440
And we need to find some solutions to some of these challenges

365
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,880
that we have enough in our, in our systems today

366
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,920
and how do we really overcome that,

367
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,520
but we're really looking up to you

368
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,080
to help us find solutions.

369
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,320
But that's clearly the intent.

370
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,000
I would really want to ask you,

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,120
what do we also want to kind of share?

372
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,760
What's our finding of the reporting

373
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,400
and how our format looks like

374
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,520
and what is it that you want to share with them?

375
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,440
In the current UCP, report, how is it?

376
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,160
Do you want to share that data also with them?

377
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,800
Yes, so we have actually have that format ready

378
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
with us, the way UCP and P,

379
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,040
asked us to report it with the total amount

380
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,760
and total aggregate level.

381
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,440
So, and we got this data from the backup data

382
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,440
where we have the spent, under different spend here.

383
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,760
So we are having a specific data set

384
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,200
for speaker fees, render fees and also it gives

385
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,200
a complete visibility how that total data is coming for.

386
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,040
So we have the backup data and from there,

387
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,200
we have generated the report.

388
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,640
Okay, so we will load your report

389
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
into the global transparency solution, right?

390
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,240
Afterwards, once you've published,

391
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,760
we will take your data excel

392
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,360
and we will load that into the global transparency solution.

393
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,400
So Matthew, do you mean to say

394
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
that once this posted entries or posted SAP line items

395
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
are reaching in the SAP IBI?

396
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
That's when we do it?

397
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,000
I need to discuss with the team

398
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,760
because you're absolutely right, sorry.

399
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,120
We already have access to the data, right?

400
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,000
Because we already have the interface with ACP,

401
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
so we don't need to reload your Excel file,

402
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
we have the data, okay?

403
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,920
Now forget about what I said and forget about what I said.

404
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,320
No, the only question mark would be on the RCF control

405
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,120
colleagues, so there are like six, so now it's nine,

406
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,400
we increase to nine.

407
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,400
We have nine RCF controls that we need to execute

408
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,640
on the countries in scope of transparency reporting.

409
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,280
And so we need to see how we do that without you

410
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,200
following the global process.

411
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
But it's manageable, we do it with the US

412
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
and they are not following the global process.

413
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,640
So just that please keep in mind that we need to work together

414
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
on the RCF controls.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,360
And it's all about colleagues,

416
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,040
it's all about reconciliation between SAP

417
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,040
and what has been reported, so it's as your face,

418
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,360
I think it's a URR, RCF, are you familiar with RCF?

419
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Yeah, so that's what I'm talking about.

420
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,800
Self-assessment, right?

421
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,320
Sorry, yeah, self-assessment,

422
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm key control testing.

423
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,440
Yeah, one that is supposed to be done in July.

424
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,240
Yeah, you're correct.

425
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,200
You're already very familiar with the process.

426
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,560
Yes, correct.

427
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,680
So reset issue, you are waiting for some time.

428
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,160
Sorry, no worries Matthew.

429
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,040
Just to commend on the question that you asked,

430
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,280
did we miss during the initial project scooping?

431
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,480
I have double verified all the URR's documentation

432
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,680
plus the confirmation that we got during the input collection

433
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,280
when we have set in the ITR also.

434
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,320
So this is not a miss,

435
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,680
the information came out to light very recently.

436
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,320
So I can share the information of course.

437
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,880
I definitely did, but I can tell from Matthew.

438
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,280
But Matthew, I think you know,

439
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,160
I don't think we should look at this as a miss

440
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,080
or a lack of support,

441
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,920
but I think being the first year of transparency,

442
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,880
supporting a lot of these aspects

443
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,840
are also learning for us as well, right?

444
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,640
So I think we are also learning as we're going along

445
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,800
and some of these pieces which were never,

446
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,200
I mean, which used to happen the way it is happening,

447
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,640
but we never really saw that.

448
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,360
For example, the posting bit,

449
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,080
it never really probably occurred to us

450
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,320
that this is the way it would be.

451
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,320
So I think it's more of a discovery phase.

452
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,000
Today as we've completed the year,

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,280
I think we are a lot more informed of how things have,

454
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,600
what things happen and how they get reported

455
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,720
and what we need to keep in mind.

456
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,360
And I think we just need to kind of really integrate

457
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,920
that into our tool,

458
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,920
but I don't need that as a miss or a lack of support.

459
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,760
I don't see it that way.

460
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I just see that as a first-time unique experience

461
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,640
that we've had.

462
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,160
And so we might not have been able to articulate everything

463
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,600
and we might not have been visible

464
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,680
of every possible thing that there is.

465
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,720
And to that extent,

466
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,160
there could also be a miss from our end,

467
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,280
but I don't see that as a lack of support from any team.

468
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,440
Definitely not.

469
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
No, no, no, I'm glad you said,

470
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,480
you're not doing this,

471
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,280
I think we're pointing to us now.

472
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,240
So I'd now appreciate that.

473
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm not really good.

474
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,320
And this is true that with the complex regulatory requirements,

475
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,120
this is true that sometimes it takes a bit,

476
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,320
it's not as straightforward as a normal FIA country.

477
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,080
So, yeah, I mean, it is what it is.

478
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
But thanks a lot.

479
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,160
So just to kind of share that's okay, Matthew.

480
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,640
So there were some member organizations

481
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
which were using GKC tools in their own,

482
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,240
it could be astral or it could be BMS, I don't remember.

483
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,360
And when they came and there were many workshops

484
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,400
that were conducted by the local association,

485
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,120
industry association on this topic, right?

486
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,120
And one that we recently participated in,

487
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,720
I think they were talking about the challenges

488
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,520
of their global GTC tool exactly on these fronts.

489
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
Yeah.

490
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,800
Because even their tool was unable to capture

491
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,560
the post-aid or the accrued ADA,

492
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,720
and it's just giving them an aggregated ones.

493
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
Because that's the requirement

494
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,960
across the other affiliate countries worldwide.

495
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,800
India is a very different, unique local, global,

496
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,920
global, the requirement of the government

497
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,560
is very, very different.

498
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,720
So then they have resorted also to manual pieces

499
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,000
and to ensure that all the member organization

500
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,720
have a standard approach.

501
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,240
So there was a directive saying

502
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,720
that let's approach it this way.

503
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,040
So it's evolving one method.

504
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,960
So honestly, time may be venting,

505
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,760
looked at the data, we really were trying to rack up brains

506
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,160
and say that, how do we do this?

507
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Can you just, yeah, please.

508
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,280
You here to understand this,

509
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,920
is there any opportunity for India to do a republication

510
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,520
or do we really strict about any republication?

511
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Why would you do a question?

512
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,880
What would a question is a case?

513
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,000
I think even this was the question that some of us asked.

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,840
Because the fear of misreporting was so high,

515
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,560
we checked with the DOP if there was a case of,

516
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,560
or if there's a possibility of re-submitting this,

517
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,840
just like your income tax, advance tax, et cetera.

518
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,160
And it's still the question up in the air.

519
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,400
We don't know.

520
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,560
We don't know what DOP,

521
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,920
because DOP is keeping all the cards pretty close to the chest.

522
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
And we really don't know what would the directives be

523
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
and how, and if they would allow us a review,

524
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,840
because a lot of companies came up with the proposal

525
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,200
that things would be a lot more clear

526
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,440
or post 31st of March.

527
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,080
And after we have submitted,

528
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
there could be a lot more clarity that would come in.

529
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,000
So do we have an opportunity to re-submitted?

530
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,560
We have had no response to this.

531
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,560
We'll have to wait and watch and see how things evolve from here.

532
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,120
The reason I wish, the way that we approach the GT solution,

533
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,680
it is same for all the markets, right?

534
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,560
But the only difference that I see between other markets

535
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,600
and India is, the window is only two months.

536
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,760
So for other countries, it is around six months.

537
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,000
So by the time when we do a disclosure for other markets,

538
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,800
all the actuals are already paid.

539
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,400
That means the clear dates already come with us, right?

540
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,640
So that we were able to disclose all the data.

541
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,560
So that's the reason I'm just looking at

542
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,960
if there is any opportunity for re-submitting the report

543
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,600
after a quarter or so, then it would solve by itself.

544
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,800
You know, the two that we have.

545
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,240
I think we have requested as an organization,

546
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,080
as an association for a window again, Sathish,

547
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,360
but there has been no response from the DOP.

548
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,160
But if that happens and if there is a second window available,

549
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,640
going forward, then GTC tool becomes the best option, right?

550
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,640
So, but without any modifications in the current way, right?

551
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Because then everything gets easily visible

552
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,240
and you can just report whatever really comes out of it.

553
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,680
But if it is not, if it is not,

554
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,480
then we might have to really rethink on the design

555
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,800
and see what can be changed

556
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,120
and how can we really capture the posted data.

557
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,080
But that's for a later date, but let's just go ahead.

558
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,120
But this is a window question.

559
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,080
It's still up in the air.

560
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,760
We don't know how it's going to manifest,

561
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,640
but just give us some time.

562
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,000
We will definitely keep you informed

563
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,880
of what and how this is evolving.

564
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
But at the stage, I'm as clueless as you are.

565
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,120
Honestly, I don't have any answer.

566
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Thank you.

567
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,360
And Chris, we'll need to do a make a reconciliation

568
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,880
between SAP and Bishur, with definitively.

569
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,680
And once there will be this reconciliation option

570
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,960
in Bishur, maybe, I mean, we have already

571
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,520
the reconciliation option in Bishur with SAP to be.

572
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
We have two media.

573
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,640
These terms are not actually linked, Matthew.

574
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,760
Be sure this app, they don't speak to each other.

575
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,960
But it's my understanding is that it's

576
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,000
planned for various in the next three days or two, right?

577
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,600
It should be available very soon.

578
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,120
Probably as a country, we don't have that information, Matthew.

579
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,320
OK, the second I will check with the person

580
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,240
with the system owner in the browser.

581
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,200
I will check that too.

582
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
I will let you know.

583
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,680
Because then, then, also, soft truths

584
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,480
will be more be sure than SAP then.

585
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,000
For you.

586
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,160
Call the particulates.

587
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,520
So Matthew, we also have another third system, which

588
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,960
is conquer, because there are times

589
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,000
when we also book the flights, et cetera,

590
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,800
accommodation through conquer.

591
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Yeah.

592
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
OK.

593
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Easy.

594
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Easy.

595
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
PCD.

596
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,760
It is not integrated.

597
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,200
The PCD is integrated with GTC.

598
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,000
It's a global transparency solution.

599
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Yeah.

600
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,560
OK.

601
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,800
I mean, look, this is a discussion we

602
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
can continue.

603
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,080
We are already over time.

604
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,720
But definitely, let's conclude.

605
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,840
Please, thanks, colleagues, so much for your manual,

606
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,920
for having prepared the disclosure manually.

607
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,080
Big, big, big thank you for that.

608
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,680
Effectively, it's a distance for us as well.

609
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,960
And let's meet after your disclosure in order

610
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,720
to make sure that we adjust our process

611
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,800
in order to make your requirements.

612
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,640
But, colleagues, we are covering 50 plus countries.

613
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,200
So I'm very sure that even if you have specific requirements,

614
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,080
we will manage.

615
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,440
We should manage.

616
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,280
We will be able to achieve that.

617
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,120
No, thank you, Matthew.

618
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,520
In fact, we definitely want to rely on GTC

619
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,240
for the upcoming reporting the next year.

620
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,880
And we will come back to you with what

621
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,200
is the status with the DOP this year.

622
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,680
We'll share with you everything that we have.

623
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
And we'll walk together and see what we can do.

624
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Fantastic.

625
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,800
Fantastic.

626
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,480
Hey, Avina, sure.

627
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,680
So I know the expectations are there

628
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,760
from the local association, just to be realistic also

629
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,160
from what we observed from the other countries

630
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,640
with the first year of disclosure.

631
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,800
Honestly, you need exactly, as you say before,

632
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,000
the companies then in a few years

633
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,240
to be at the level that is expected from the association.

634
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,880
So I wouldn't worry too much to be honest with you.

635
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
Absolutely.

636
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,840
It's just that there have been a few instances

637
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,600
where the government is being a little hard

638
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,880
on a couple of organizations.

639
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
So we just don't want to be on the wrong side.

640
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,680
And it's just that all the presidents

641
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,480
are just being doubly careful, more cautious than brave.

642
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,600
So I think we'll get there.

643
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,680
So hopefully the ticket can lead to fines.

644
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,360
It's more than fines.

645
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,280
They won't be prosecuted.

646
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,440
Is it a loo or is it a good?

647
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:50,960
It's a loo.

648
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
So what?

649
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,640
So I think in the first year, given one

650
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,400
of the member organizations, the government

651
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,080
has come so hard that it's not just so a lot of agencies

652
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,640
can really come after you, the income tax.

653
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,440
And all of the investigative agencies

654
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,040
can really open, can come knocking on the doors.

655
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,400
This is this.

656
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,840
And that's the worry.

657
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,520
And all your books of account are going to be opened up.

658
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,560
So I don't know how this will mature.

659
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,240
And given the first year, at this point of time,

660
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,800
it's only conjecture.

661
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
But I think if we will have to just wait and watch

662
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
what's the maturity with which government really

663
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,920
looks at this and how it handles this.

664
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,160
But at this point of time, it really

665
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,560
looks very draconian.

666
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,320
And it's more fear.

667
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,760
And hence, people are a little cautious

668
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,640
and don't want to be on the wrong side.

669
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,920
So that's the whole idea, Matthew.

670
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,920
OK.

671
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,440
Look, we are here.

672
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,720
So it's not because you agree that you will do it manually.

673
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,640
If you need any help, we are a big team.

674
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,000
40 plus people.

675
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,160
We are here to support you.

676
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,080
So should you need our help to reduce something,

677
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,160
to load data for you or whatever it is,

678
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,720
just let us know.

679
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,440
Really big help, Matthew.

680
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,680
Thanks a ton to you and your team for the help and support.

681
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,720
And Rashi has been of great help.

682
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,880
And I don't see it again.

683
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,720
I want to re-emphasize.

684
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,240
I don't think it's a lack of support.

685
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,720
In fact, we've had a lot of support.

686
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,800
And I can go and record to say this.

687
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,240
And at least the last six months, I've

688
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,040
missed a lot of support.

689
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,320
And I think it's because it's an evolving and a dynamic one,

690
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,320
it's possible that we've also missed a couple of things.

691
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,960
But just give us this one cycle.

692
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,000
And we'll see how it goes from year on.

693
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Sounds big.

694
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,480
Sounds big.

695
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,320
And thanks for saying that about the team.

696
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,880
I had not done that up to 30.

697
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,400
But thanks for saying.

698
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,920
Thank you so much.

699
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,680
Take care.

700
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,200
We stay here.

701
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Thanks a lot.

702
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,720
Thank you.

703
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Thank you.

704
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,560
Thank you.

705
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,200
Take care, everyone.

706
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,960
Hey, thanks.
