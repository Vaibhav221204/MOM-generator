00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone!

00:10.000 --> 00:17.900
Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get

00:17.900 --> 00:19.920
started.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.800
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

00:25.800 --> 00:28.960
Yes, of course, Tony.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.960
No problem.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
Thanks.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.960
Okay, let's get the ball rolling.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.960
First on the agenda today.

00:40.960 --> 00:48.960
Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy for our new beverage,

00:48.960 --> 00:50.960
Ginger Cola?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.960
Yes, Tony.

00:52.960 --> 01:01.960
Well, we have decided to pitch the new Ginger Cola as a health and energy drink.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.960
Fantastic.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.960
I think this will be our next big hit.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.960
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.960
It tastes great.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.960
It's healthy.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.960
And it has very low calories.

01:21.960 --> 01:25.960
It's perfect for working out.

01:25.960 --> 01:30.960
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.960
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

01:35.960 --> 01:44.960
We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter

01:44.960 --> 01:49.960
from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.960
We still have to iron out some details.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.960
But we think he's a great fit.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.960
Great idea.

01:59.960 --> 02:09.960
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.

02:09.960 --> 02:13.960
Of course, that's really important.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.960
But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.960
Okay, Tony.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.960
I will be ready to present to everyone then.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.960
Let's move on to the next topic.

02:28.960 --> 02:34.960
I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.

02:34.960 --> 02:45.960
It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.

02:46.960 --> 02:52.960
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.960
This is extremely important for us.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.960
We need to give back to the community.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.960
I couldn't agree more.

03:03.960 --> 03:08.960
This has been at the top of all our agendas.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.960
And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
Let me start things off.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.960
If that's okay with everyone else.
