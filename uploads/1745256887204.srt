00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,900
Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,920
started.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,800
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,960
Yes, of course, Tony.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
No problem.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Thanks.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Okay, let's get the ball rolling.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
First on the agenda today.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy for our new beverage,

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Ginger Cola?

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Yes, Tony.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Well, we have decided to pitch the new Ginger Cola as a health and energy drink.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Fantastic.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I think this will be our next big hit.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,960
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,960
It tastes great.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
It's healthy.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
And it has very low calories.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,960
It's perfect for working out.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,960
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:44,960
We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,960
from the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,960
We still have to iron out some details.

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,960
But we think he's a great fit.

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Great idea.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you have planned.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Of course, that's really important.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,960
But we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Okay, Tony.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,960
I will be ready to present to everyone then.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Let's move on to the next topic.

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:45,960
It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming charity walkathon.

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,960
This is extremely important for us.

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,960
We need to give back to the community.

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,960
I couldn't agree more.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,960
This has been at the top of all our agendas.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,960
And we have come up with some pretty innovative ideas.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Let me start things off.

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,960
If that's okay with everyone else.
