1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
So we are taking it from SAP only.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,320
Then we are good.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,480
So I need the, I mean, this I would effectively

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,080
be in favor to use the global transparency solution

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,480
for the reporting of one of the legal entities,

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,680
but I really want the local compliance team

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,000
to be comfortable with that.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,320
So Matthew, really, the challenge is here on the second point.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,480
The legal entity we already discussed earlier with Rashi.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,920
And there was a work around that they proposed right now,

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
which we could have worked.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,080
But challenge really is the second point

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,880
where we would have to capture the posting data as well,

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,480
which is not there currently in the SAP IPA report.

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
So that means we will have a missing data coming

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,680
in the IPA report.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,280
OK.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,120
Just on this front, I don't.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,560
So this is very different.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,160
Usually transparency reporting is based on payment.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,200
So we are disclosing what Novartis effectively

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,840
give to HCPs, HCOs, and patient organizations.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,640
What I'm trying to understand is, are we sure

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,000
that this is the regulatory requirement

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,040
to disclose at an event level and not at payment level?

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,520
Because this is very new to me.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,600
We don't have such situation in any of the 50

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,000
plus countries that we are managing.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,240
So Matthew, you're absolutely correct.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,040
So Novartis, not Novartis, India

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,120
has got a pre-unique regulatory requirement

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,520
which requires the pharmaceutical organizations

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,440
to report at the event level, which

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,040
means once an event happens and the provisions are made.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,600
So the postings that happens through the financial reporting

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,520
needs to be captured.

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
And this clarification has been

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
grow, has been received through the industry association

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,640
and also through the Department of Pharmaceuticals

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,720
for India.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
So this is a directive that we've...

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,400
So what happens is, March 31st is the annual year

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,280
so events that happen the last week or in the month,

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,840
depending on the contract of the vendors,

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
the payment will not get processed in time,

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
but it will get provisioned.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
And if it gets provisioned, it can still be posted.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Yeah.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,840
The payment can happen at a later stage.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,600
So that needs to be...

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,000
And because the event has happened within the fiscal year,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,920
it needs to be captured in the report.

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,480
Nice images.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,720
OK.

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,440
But so...

56
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,920
And we have a clear view on what has been accrued

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,320
as of March 31st that needs to be reported

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,680
to we have a clear visibility on the accords.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Really?

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,280
Absolutely.

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,080
Absolutely, yes.

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah.

63
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,640
I know that there are payment that are posted,

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,960
which have to be considered for the purpose of reporting.

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,160
But if you are asking clear visibility,

66
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,120
as in we don't have that split between what is the exact payment

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,160
that needs to be...

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,320
That is in the posting case state.

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,000
Because that keeps on changing a week after week.

70
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
Can you repeat this last sentence?

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,520
I'll teach you the issue of the...

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,560
So if you have the accords...

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,440
Let's assume you have an event of 100.

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,200
60 has been already invoiced as of March 1st,

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
so it's in...

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,480
And it has been paid, sorry, as in paid.

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,280
So it's already in ACP.

78
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,200
You have 40.

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,560
You know that the service has been executed,

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,400
so you have 40 that has been accrued.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,360
But by March 31st, this has not been paid.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,720
But those 40, if I understand well the rule

83
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,480
that we have in India, those 40 needs to be reflected.

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,480
But with the accords that have been done,

85
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,240
we should be able to link the accrued amount

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,840
with the event, no?

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,840
So, Matthew, we don't have this event

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,160
while identification.

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,040
There is a payment that does not happen yet.

90
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,520
So we don't have events by event,

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,400
the split between paid and a bank, okay.

92
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
But then, colleagues, I mean, you know, I will never...

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,760
I mean, please don't get us wrong.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,680
We will never force you to use a system

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,240
that you are not comfortable to use.

96
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
Honestly, considering the situation

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,200
and considering that we need to report by the end of the week,

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
this is really...

99
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,200
I mean, we need to go with what we use,

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,880
what we feel is the best solution.

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,240
The thing is, if you don't have it for the global transparency solution,

102
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,160
you will not have it neither for in Excel, right?

103
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,960
Or how do you plan to solve this?

104
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,040
You see what I mean?

105
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920
You see what I mean?

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,960
If you don't have an ACP and you don't have the accrual per events,

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,240
even if you are not using the global transparency solution

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,480
and you do the reporting manually, how will you do that?

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay, so the payment which has been happened in SAP

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,440
that we can find out from SAP IBI.

111
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,920
Now, the issue right now, what we are having,

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,280
that those events which happen in February, March,

113
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,640
their invoice are being posted in SAP,

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,560
but that does not been paid

115
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,200
because payment would happen

116
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,720
basis the credit arms of the vendors.

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,560
But received not invoiced.

118
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,440
Yes.

119
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,440
So if we can see, we may see our status in SAP

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,600
as a post date or created or index,

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,320
but not the paid.

122
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,920
And that paid goes to SAP IBI.

123
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,640
So those payments basis the SAP individual data,

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,640
we have taken an account and factored for reporting,

125
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,640
but those data is completely missed in this SAP IBI report.

126
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,520
Probably in future, one, two months,

127
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,760
probably two months down the line, we may get the data.

128
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,240
So that is the reason, you know,

129
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,920
the manual data captured all which are paid plus provision

130
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,760
plus, you know, posted.

131
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Okay.

132
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,800
Matthew, just to simplify,

133
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
in be sure we've always captured the quotation

134
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,920
as well as invoices, basis there,

135
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,960
the tracking was already prepared by the third party,

136
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,440
which captures against which event,

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,880
which are the payments pending to be posted

138
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,320
and which are already in the SAP.

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,000
So we have that available,

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
but it is just that we don't have a report

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
which clearly by for case,

142
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,280
what is paid and posted in SAP right now.

143
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,440
So it was a manual effort that has enabled us to reconcile

144
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
all of this, Matthew.

145
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Yeah.

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
Yeah, Matthew.

147
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
Yeah.

148
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,040
And there were two other three,

149
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,960
I mean, incidentals, but important.

150
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,600
One, this is the first time, of course,

151
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,440
India is coming under the Transparency Reporting Act

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,680
and which means and also given whatever indications

153
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,480
that we have, the multinational organizations

154
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,680
are going to be under a lot more scrutiny

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,600
than the local organizations are.

156
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,920
They've already made an example of one of the multinational

157
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,200
organizations a few months back on one of the breaches

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
and all indications are that all multinational organizations

159
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
are going to be under heavy scrutiny

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,440
for at least the cycle, right?

161
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,680
So so hence there has been a lot of reliance on

162
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,600
what is going to be a uniform standard approach

163
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,760
to reporting across the members,

164
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,160
the member organizations of the association

165
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,840
and we are having a uniform approach towards

166
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,080
reporting some of these, right?

167
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,000
So so we are being a lot more conservative

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,200
and not aggressive and we are ensuring that

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,520
even the ones which have been accrued

170
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,000
and one spare services have been taken

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,040
but payments will be made at a later stage

172
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,240
that still will report it.

173
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,280
There is a provision where we have

174
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,120
used disclaimers and we've also put in those comments

175
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,640
but not exhaustive limited comments

176
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,920
just to ensure that some of the clarity could be

177
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,960
provided towards some of these items.

178
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,520
So hence the concern on how we really show up

179
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,960
in the first year of reporting.

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,520
But I've been asked then, are you telling me

181
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,760
that you already have done the data collection, right?

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,040
For what you believe should be disclosed

183
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,200
by the end of this week.

184
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,080
You have for the truly guarantees.

185
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,920
Yeah.

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
I mean,

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,040
so what is the question today?

188
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,560
Is it, are you asking for an exemption

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,760
to use the global solution and the global end

190
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
to follow the global process?

191
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,800
No, that's the internal Matthew.

192
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,560
Just to bring you over.

193
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,800
Thank you.

194
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,640
Thank you.

195
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,560
That is from the country is to go with the manual

196
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
disclosure, not for the standard global

197
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,520
transparency solution because very simply implemented.

198
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm absolutely, but for me it's fine.

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Absolutely.

200
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,960
I mean, I will never prevent you to do what you feel

201
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,920
it's best for you.

202
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,080
We are no one to say they were.

203
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,680
I mean, I feel it's a little bit ashamed

204
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,160
that the teams spend so much effort to implement.

205
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,360
I don't know exactly if we missed something

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,920
in the business requirements or if we did not

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,640
enough listen to you.

208
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,800
But obviously if you have the report really

209
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,800
in with the manual data collection

210
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,760
and you feel comfortable with the figures,

211
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
you should report that you have definitively.

212
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,880
I mean, I don't know.

213
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,560
I mean, actually, it's what you were asking for more.

214
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
That was the, that was the ask, Matthew.

215
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,760
And also there were a couple of other evolving

216
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
situations.

217
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,280
The other evolving situation was one of the

218
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,320
East signatories to the transparency report

219
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
was the country president.

220
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,960
And the country president would have

221
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,680
to record his signature on the report

222
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,080
before the report is presented.

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,160
And he was also traveling.

224
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,240
So he's currently out of the country.

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
So before he moved out of the country

226
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,200
or official business, we had to kind of see the report

227
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,840
and be comfortable with what was captured in the report.

228
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,560
So if, and those were the pieces.

229
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,960
And of course, all of this was in accordance

230
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,200
in line with how the association guided us.

231
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,400
And what was the directive in terms of how

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,080
it had to be presented.

233
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,160
So those were the things.

234
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,800
So of course, Wade in also very heavily.

235
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,640
And hence the ask and the request from our side.

236
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,200
I mean, no, no, so let's go apparently you're already

237
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
you're done with the reporting.

238
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,040
So let's continue what you've initiated.

239
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Just first of all, and I hope let's be,

240
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,640
let's speak honestly and transparently

241
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,280
even if the team is on the phone today.

242
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,840
But do you feel that we as a global transparency team,

243
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
we miss something about your requirements.

244
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,080
And using that, there was a miss during the project

245
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,080
that we explaining why we are facing this situation today.

246
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
Matthew, I'm really sorry.

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
I don't have the historical reference

248
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,840
because I got into the role six months back.

249
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:25,400
And I'm just carrying the work that was already underway.

250
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,760
So I'm not really sure of what conversations have happened

251
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,160
before.

252
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm really sorry.

253
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm not able to throw much light on that.

254
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
OK, maybe satish one last question.

255
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,400
And then I ended up to you.

256
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,240
So all the nation and the Russian

257
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,320
they are, are you comfortable also?

258
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,800
And can we say that even if this one is done manually?

259
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,120
First, we would need to, if this is OK with you,

260
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,600
we would need to load the data into the global transparency

261
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,280
solution because for internal analytics purpose,

262
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,400
we need to have a full view of the total transfer

263
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,400
of values for the company because we are presenting, for example,

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,240
to Patrick Harper on Monday.

265
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,480
And he wants to see the entire, the entire tier of this.

266
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,920
But this one and they were so more importantly

267
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,280
because this one is just for internal analytics.

268
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
But more importantly, are you comfortable

269
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
that for the, I mean, are you OK, sorry?

270
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
That for the future, we will really understand

271
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,160
what, how we should address the issues

272
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,240
and moving forward, find a solution for you

273
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,720
to get the data directly from the global solution

274
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,000
because colleagues, these should save significant time

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,960
from you, right?

276
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,280
And so sorry that you spent so much time

277
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,640
on transparency, but I think in the future,

278
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,320
we should be able to provide you something

279
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
that you are mostly comfortable with.

280
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,000
And you just review and sign off if you agree with you.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,600
OK, absolutely, not absolutely, Matthew.

282
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
And I think that's the whole idea.

283
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,800
And we would definitely going forward,

284
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,520
like to rely on the global transparency tool.

285
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,200
And we need to find some solutions to some of these challenges

286
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,640
that we have enough in our systems today.

287
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,680
And how do we really overcome that?

288
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,280
But we're really looking up to you

289
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,840
to help us find solutions.

290
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,320
But that's clearly the intent.

291
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,960
I would really want to ask, you know what,

292
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
what do we also want to kind of share?

293
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,520
What's our finding of the reporting?

294
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,560
And how our format looks like and what

295
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,800
does it that you want to share with them?

296
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
In the current UCP API report, how is it?

297
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Do you want to share that data also with them?

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,600
So we have actually had that format ready.

299
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,680
We passed the way UCPMP asked us to report it

300
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,520
with the total amount and total aggregate level.

301
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,200
So and we got this data from the backup data

302
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:09,200
where we have the spin under different spin here.

303
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,560
So we are very specific data set

304
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,000
for speaker fees, render fees, and also it gives

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,400
a complete visibility how that total data is coming for.

306
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,880
So we have the backup data and from there,

307
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,880
we have generated the report.

308
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
OK.

309
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,680
So we will load your report into the global transparency

310
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,040
solution, right?

311
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,160
Afterwards, once you've published, we

312
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,920
will take your data and we will load that into the global

313
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,960
transparency search.

314
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,400
So Matthew, do you mean to say that once this posted entries

315
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,520
or posted SAP line items are reaching in the SAP IBI?

316
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,320
That's when we do it?

317
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
I need to discuss with the team because you

318
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,560
are absolutely right, sorry.

319
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,920
We already have access to the data, right?

320
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,840
Because we already have the interface with SAP.

321
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,200
So we don't need to reload your Excel file.

322
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,240
We have the data.

323
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,680
OK, now forget about what I said and forget about what I said.

324
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
No, the only question math would be on the RCF control

325
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,680
colleagues.

326
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,920
So there are like six, so now it's nine.

327
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,200
We increase to nine.

328
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:29,840
We have nine RCF controls that we need to execute on the countries

329
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,400
scope of transparency reporting.

330
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,040
And so we need to see how we do that without you

331
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,960
following the global process.

332
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,720
But it's manageable.

333
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,200
We do it with the data.
