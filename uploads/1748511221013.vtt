00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
So we just have two months to ensure all the payments are cleared and ensure we get into the report.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
So have you experienced any situation like this where some of the payments which are not cleared?

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
In that case the event still falls in the year within the year but the payment happens after the financial year.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
So how are the pharmaceutical companies reporting? Do we have a window again to update the report?

00:34.000 --> 00:46.000
So generally for the other country reports we have a more broad let's say timeline.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
I can ask you to the authority in India if they have any suggestion.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm not sure if we have seen something similar in the past but I will check also internally.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
So basically the thing is that even if you have done the activities in the year sometimes the payment came.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
I mean come after the two months where you are expected to collect all the expenses.

01:21.000 --> 01:30.000
Right now we can look at the approved amounts in wise amounts before even making the payment.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
So I'm consolidated all of it for the services that we have utilized and make the report.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
Now what happens is but when we automate the systems the payment comes into the next period.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
But the payment still shows in the previous period.

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
So there will be a conflict in terms of the consolidation and reporting and this is going to be there forever.

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
So any kind of suggestions or guidance over this will there be any secondary window that will be opened up.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
If I have dated payments you know ideally it should be so that you know all that we are trying to do is generally get the data.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
You know voluntary report.

02:21.000 --> 02:34.000
So another but another thing that we can ask to the authority is that if it's possible to make amendments to what was disclosed.

02:34.000 --> 02:46.000
Just because of this situation so from from a legal perspective I think I can check with the authority and we can find a solution.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
From a system perspective I don't think there's anything to change at the moment for Audi.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
We don't have to add but what I personally feel is for no what is we have two company courts.

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
So right now I think we have we have provision only one report for India but more you know I think we have to generate two reports

03:13.000 --> 03:21.000
because we have one what is okay limited and no what is in the unlimited and we have got payments.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
So we have to segregate that.

03:25.000 --> 03:38.000
Okay I think yeah on that we can we can definitely divide into two different entities but I see that there's Sara.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Everyone apology for being late.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
No but I mean I was like I was informed that she was late and I wouldn't have started if not.

03:49.000 --> 04:06.000
So Sara basically the the figure that we we would need to check with the with the local authority is what happened if the payment is done after the so basically the reports.

04:06.000 --> 04:20.000
The reporting period ends in December but then the reporting is done after two months but some payments are not yet done after two months from the closing of the year.

04:21.000 --> 04:38.000
So we have these payments that are outside both reporting period basically because they are not fully collected in the correct year but neither on the second year because the activities is from the previous year.

04:38.000 --> 05:06.000
So basically what we need to check is if they can correct or amend the reporting done or if there's any best practice to follow like doing it the next year or reporting in a different way the expenses that are not yet paid before the deadline.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
I don't know if you have any any other suggestion on that or ideas.

05:12.000 --> 05:25.000
No we can we can double check what what should be the approach to be followed for what regards IITR you know guys we have it as a standard.

05:26.000 --> 05:41.000
The possibility to run delta reports and so to include only the leftovers maybe lay payments that were uploaded in the system later compared with the deadlines and whatsoever.

05:41.000 --> 05:54.000
So you could run a delta maybe or you could even decide to generate a second version of the report and entire second version of the report including also the leftovers that were loaded in a later stage.

05:55.000 --> 06:10.000
I think as long as the regulatory allows any of these options you know it would be a good solution altogether and I believe you know not just no artist all the farmers and farmer companies will have the same issue technically.

06:10.000 --> 06:23.000
So maybe some kind of a guidance over there and then we can see if it has to be a updated report with consolidation or the leftover part.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Okay. We will we will investigate it.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
This is not very urgent.

06:32.000 --> 06:42.000
But the sooner it is better because again we missed the second semester of this year then we will end up in the same situation for the next year.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
Right now we have decided to provision all the you know pending payments also into the report manually.

06:50.000 --> 07:02.000
Unfortunately we cannot use the IITR report for this disclosure but we will try to make some corrections and kind of keep the systems up and running.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Okay. Do you have any of the question?

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
Shasateesh came because of some late payments that came in.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Late payments that are not done it.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay.

07:16.000 --> 07:29.000
So not meaning it so that means we have to provision it because you know the country team is very particular about ensuring everything anything the services are received.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
They want to show the amounts.

07:31.000 --> 07:39.000
They do not want to say because the penalty is and the consequences could be higher because there is no proper guidance over it.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
Once we have the guidance then I think we can relax this you know constantly.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah there might be also some follow ups by the government.

07:49.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm assuming considering that it is the first year reporting and I think they will start receiving some questions as such maybe they hopefully they will release on frequently asked questions.

08:01.000 --> 08:13.000
And what we also heard is the country ERC head has already been in touch with the authorities and there were questions around it but there is no proper response.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Maybe that's where I thought you know I will seek your help to see if your contacts can help.

08:18.000 --> 08:26.000
Maybe there is a guideline or something that they are trying to establish because these questions are pretty normal you know.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Yes of course.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay let's decide.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Sorry sorry.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
No no no.

08:38.000 --> 08:49.000
So conclude from if we if we take the info specifications that is currently the specs are to disclose the report based on the activity dates.

08:49.000 --> 09:00.000
So even if a payment is loaded in 2026 for example when you are you have to disclose it as part of an activity of 2025.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Yes.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
The debt that you will work in any way any day it's also the read the complete read down should work.

09:06.000 --> 09:14.000
But again let's let's try to get an understanding of what should be on the approach to the authorities.

09:14.000 --> 09:26.000
Because for us it will be considered as a republication if we are updating that we need to get a sign off in the first place from the transparency change board.

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
And if the country provisions that you know maybe after three months or four months another update to the report it will be much easier.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
We don't have to change anything.

09:38.000 --> 09:52.000
Okay then I think so basically it's not the payment is a so the problem is not when the payment happened but when you are the expense.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Correct.

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay so basically when it is cleared is when we will hit the systems the information will hit the system then we will be able to consolidate it.

10:04.000 --> 10:15.000
Because you have an automation that clear the expense when it is paid right correct.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Okay now I understand.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay let's try to get in touch with the authority.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
Okay and any any 22 timeline then this could be shared across.

10:34.000 --> 10:44.000
So we will reach out also today I mean tomorrow at the latest but the problem is when the answer and we cannot provide a time limit.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
Okay then let us settle that during our next monthly correct and see if we have an answer.

10:50.000 --> 11:02.000
If we don't receive any answer before we can we can share let's say a second request during our next call.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Okay sounds good.

11:04.000 --> 11:19.000
Yes I think just to keep everybody honest here we reached out already I think a couple of three months ago to address a question that came in but we did not receive any answer back then.

11:19.000 --> 11:30.000
So just to set the expectation not not sure if we will be able to get a reply when we will try to follow up more and more that for sure.

11:30.000 --> 11:42.000
But yeah we didn't get much much response so far actually no responses so far so I can understand.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
Okay let's hope for the best we get some response and some window you know when we get home now.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay thank you very much.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Okay thank you so much.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Thank you thank you.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Thank you bye.
