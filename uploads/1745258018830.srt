1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,960
Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
started.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,760
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
Yes, of course, Tony.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
No problem.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Thanks.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Okay.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Let's get the ball rolling.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
First on the agenda today.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing strategy for our new beverage,

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Ginger Cola?

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Yes, Tony.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Well, we have decided to pitch the new Ginger Cola as a health and energy drink.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Fantastic.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,440
I think this will be our next big hit.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,160
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,880
It tastes great.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,160
It's healthy.

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,880
And it has very low calories.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
It's perfect for working out.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,520
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,080
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:45,320
We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter from

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,280
the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,280
We still have to iron out some details, but we think he's a great fit.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Great idea.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,480
have planned.

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,280
Of course, that's really important, but we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,120
Okay, Tony.

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,920
I will be ready to present to everyone then.

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
Let's move on to the next topic.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,400
I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,760
It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,240
charity Walkathon.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,520
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,200
This is extremely important for us.

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,000
We need to give back to the community.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,600
I couldn't agree more.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,840
This has been at the top of all our agendas, and we have come up with some pretty innovative

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,200
ideas.

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,600
Let me start things off.

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
If that's okay with everyone else...
