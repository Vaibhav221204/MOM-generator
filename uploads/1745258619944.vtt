00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everyone!

00:10.000 --> 00:17.960
Tim and Melinda are running late, but we have a lot to get through, so we should get

00:17.960 --> 00:19.960
started.

00:19.960 --> 00:25.720
Jason, can you please take the minutes today?

00:25.720 --> 00:29.000
Yes, of course, Tony.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
No problem.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Thanks.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.120
Okay, let's get the ball rolling.

00:38.120 --> 00:45.840
First on the agenda today, Carrie, can you please give us an update on the marketing

00:45.840 --> 00:51.000
strategy for our new beverage, ginger cola?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Yes, Tony.

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, we have decided to pitch the new ginger cola as a health and energy drink.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Fantastic.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.440
I think this will be our next big hit.

01:09.440 --> 01:14.160
There is no reason that it shouldn't be a winner.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.880
It tastes great.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.160
It's healthy.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.880
And it has very low calories.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.640
It's perfect for working out.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.520
Let's make this the next Red Bull energy drink.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.080
Where are we with the advertising and promotion strategy?

01:37.080 --> 01:45.320
We still have a few things to work out, but we are planning to have a power hitter from

01:45.320 --> 01:50.280
the Japan baseball league as a celebrity endorsement.

01:50.280 --> 01:58.320
We still have to iron out some details, but we think he's a great fit.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.640
Great idea.

01:59.640 --> 02:08.280
Well, let's set aside more time at the next meeting for a more in-depth look at what you

02:08.280 --> 02:10.480
have planned.

02:10.480 --> 02:18.280
Of course, that's really important, but we have a lot to cover in today's meeting.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.120
Okay, Tony.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.920
I will be ready to present to everyone then.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.280
Let's move on to the next topic.

02:29.280 --> 02:35.400
I have sent around an action list for each of you to take a look at.

02:35.400 --> 02:43.760
It includes a look at the following calls to action that we need to address for the upcoming

02:43.760 --> 02:47.240
charity Walkathon.

02:47.240 --> 02:53.520
Let's take a few moments and go over everyone's role.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.200
This is extremely important for us.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.000
We need to give back to the community.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.600
I couldn't agree more.

03:04.600 --> 03:11.840
This has been at the top of all our agendas, and we have come up with some pretty innovative

03:11.840 --> 03:14.200
ideas.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.600
Let me start things off.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
If that's okay with everyone else...
